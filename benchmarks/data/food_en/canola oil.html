Canola was developed through conventional plant breeding from <a href="/Rapeseed" title="Rapeseed">rapeseed</a>, an oilseed plant already used in ancient civilization as a fuel. The word &#34;rape&#34; in rapeseed comes from the Latin word <i>rapum</i> meaning turnip. <a href="/Turnip" title="Turnip">Turnip</a>, <a href="/Rutabaga" title="Rutabaga">rutabaga</a>, <a href="/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="/Brussels_sprouts" title="Brussels sprouts">Brussels sprouts</a>, <a href="/Mustard_plant" title="Mustard plant">mustard</a>, and many other vegetables are related to the two natural canola varieties commonly grown, which are cultivars of <i>B. napus</i> and <i>B. rapa</i>. The change in name serves to distinguish it from natural rapeseed oil, which has much higher erucic acid content.</p>
<p><i>Brassica</i> oilseed varieties are some of the oldest plants cultivated by humanity, with documentation of its use in India 4,000 years ago, and use in China and Japan 2,000 years ago.&#60;ref name=Snowdon&#62;Snowdon R et al. &#34;Oilseed Rape&#34;.  Chapter 2 in <a class="external text" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wKWulH2TFh4C" rel="nofollow">Genome Mapping and Molecular Breeding in Plants: OIlseeds</a>. Ed, Chittaranjan Kole.  Springer, 2007&#60;/ref&#62;{{rp|55}}  Its use in Northern Europe for oil lamps is documented to the 13th century.&#60;ref name=Snowdon/&#62;  Its use was limited until the development of <a href="/Steam_power" title="Steam power">steam power</a>, when machinists found rapeseed oil clung to water- and steam-washed metal surfaces better than other lubricants. <a href="/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> caused high demand for the oil as a lubricant for the rapidly increasing number of steam engines in naval and merchant ships. When the war blocked European and Asian sources of rapeseed oil, a critical shortage developed, and Canada began to expand its limited rapeseed production.</p>
<p>After the war, demand declined sharply, and farmers began to look for other uses for the plant and its products. Rapeseed oil extracts were first put on the market in 1956–1957 as food products, but these suffered from several unacceptable characteristics. Rapeseed oil had a distinctive taste and a disagreeable greenish color, due to the presence of <a href="/Chlorophyll" title="Chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a>. It also contained a high concentration of erucic acid. Experiments on animals have pointed to the possibility that erucic acid, consumed in large quantities, may cause heart damage, although Indian researchers have published findings that call into question these conclusions and the implication that the consumption of mustard or rapeseed oil is dangerous.&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite journal|author= Ghafoorunissa | title = Fats in Indian Diets and Their Nutritional and health Implications | journal = Lipids | year=  1996 | volume = 31 | pages = S287–S291 | doi = 10.1007/BF02637093|pmid= 8729136 | issue=1}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF02534427|author= Shenolikar, I | title = Fatty Acid Profile of Myocardial Lipid in Populations Consuming Different Dietary Fats | journal = Lipids | year=  1980 | volume = 15 | pages = 980–982 | issue=11}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF02534418|author= Bellenand, JF; Baloutch, G; Ong, N; Lecerf, J | title = Effects of Coconut Oil on Heart Lipids and on Fatty Acid Utilization in Rapeseed Oil | journal = Lipids | year=  1980 | volume = 15 | pages = 938–943 | issue=11}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal|author= Achaya, KT | title = Fat Status of Indians – A Review | journal = Journal of Scientific &#38; Industrial Research | year=  1987 | volume = 46 |issue=3| pages = 112–126}}&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;{{Cite journal|author= Indu, M; Ghafoorunissa | title = n-3 Fatty Acids in Indian Diets – Comparison of the Effects of Precursor (Alpha-Linolenic Acid) vs Product (Long chain n-3 Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids) | journal = Nutrition Research | year=  1992 | volume = 12 | pages = 569–582 | doi = 10.1016/S0271-5317(05)80027-2|issue= 4–5}}&#60;/ref&#62; Feed meal from the rapeseed plant also was not particularly appealing to livestock, because of high levels of sharp-tasting compounds called glucosinolates.</p>

Canola oil is made at a processing facility by slightly heating and then crushing the seed. Almost all commercial canola oil is then extracted using <a href="/Hexane" title="Hexane">hexane</a>, which is recovered at the end of processing. Finally, the canola oil is refined using water precipitation and organic acid to remove gums and free fatty acids, filtering to remove color, and deodorizing using steam distillation.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external free" href="http://www.canolainfo.org/canola/index.php?page=6&#60;/ref&#38;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.canolainfo.org/canola/index.php?page=6&#60;/ref&#38;gt</a>;  Cold-pressed and expeller-pressed canola oil are also produced on a more limited basis.
