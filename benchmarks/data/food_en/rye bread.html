<p><b>Rye bread</b> is a type of <a href="/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a> made with various proportions of <a href="/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> from <a href="/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a> grain. It can be light or dark in color, depending on the type of flour used and the addition of coloring agents, and is typically denser than bread made from <a href="/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a> flour. It is higher in <a href="/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">fiber</a> than white bread and is often darker in color and stronger in flavor.

<p>
While rye and wheat are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as <a href="/Triticale" title="Triticale">triticale</a>), their biochemistries differ enough that they affect the breadmaking process. The key issue is differing <a href="/Amylase" title="Amylase">amylases</a>, the enzyme which breaks <a href="/Starch" title="Starch">starch</a> down into <a href="/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>. While wheat amylases are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat <a href="/Gluten" title="Gluten">gluten</a> that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (<a href="/Secalin" title="Secalin">secalin</a>) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and <a href="/Pentosan" title="Pentosan">pentosans</a>. As a result, amylases in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.&#60;ref&#62;Daniel Wing and Alan Scott, <i>The Bread Builders</i>. White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green Publishing, 1999.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>There are two common solutions: The traditional manner, developed where obtaining wheat was traditionally impractical because of marginal growing conditions or supply difficulties, uses dough acidification to impede the function of rye amylases. Lowering dough pH, however, compromises the use of relatively acid-intolerant <i><a href="/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="Saccharomyces cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></i>-based &#34;<a href="/Baker&#39;s_yeast" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">baker&#39;s yeast</a>&#34;. Instead, addition of naturally acidic <i>Lactobacillus</i> &#34;<a href="/Sourdough" title="Sourdough">sourdough</a>&#34; cultures lowers bread pH, provides an acid-tolerant yeast strain, and helps <a href="/Starch_gelatinization" title="Starch gelatinization">gelatinize starches</a> in the dough matrix. The byproduct of this approach is lighter breads.</p>
<p>In areas where high-gluten hard wheat is readily available the need for a complex polyculture of bacteria and yeast can often be reduced or removed by adding a large proportion of hard wheat flour to the rye flour. Its added gluten compensates for amylase activity on the starch in the dough, allowing the bread to retain its structure as it bakes. The &#34;deli rye&#34; tradition in the United States is based upon this mixing of grains. Use of high-gluten wheat flour also makes possible multigrain breads, such as the &#34;rye and Indian&#34; bread of the American colonies, which combined rye and wheat with <a href="/Cornmeal" title="Cornmeal">cornmeal</a> in one loaf.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|author=Peterborough Historical Society (NH) |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.colonialsense.com/Society-Lifestyle/Recipes/Recipe_Page.php?CS=153" rel="nofollow">http://www.colonialsense.com/Society-Lifestyle/Recipes/Recipe_Page.php?CS=153</a> |title=Society-Lifestyle: Recipes: Breads-Cakes: Rye and Indian Bread |publisher=Colonial Sense |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Pure rye bread contains only rye flour, without any wheat. German-style <a href="/Pumpernickel" title="Pumpernickel">pumpernickel</a>, a dark, dense, and close-textured loaf, is made from crushed or ground whole rye grains, usually without wheat flour, baked for long periods at low temperature in a covered tin. Rye and wheat flours are often used to produce a rye bread with a lighter texture, color and flavor than pumpernickel. &#34;Light&#34; or &#34;dark&#34; rye flour can be used to make rye bread; the flour is classified according to the amount of bran left in the flour after milling. Caramel or molasses for coloring and <a href="/Caraway" title="Caraway">caraway</a> seeds are often added to rye bread. In the United States, breads labeled as &#34;rye&#34; nearly always contain caraway unless explicitly labeled as &#34;unseeded.&#34; In Canada (especially Montreal), breads labeled as &#34;rye&#34; often have no seeds, whereas breads labeled as &#34;kimmel&#34; are usually rye with caraway seeds. Some unique rye bread recipes include ground spices such as fennel, coriander, aniseed, cardamom, or <a href="/Citrus" title="Citrus">citrus</a> peel. In addition to caramel and molasses, ingredients such as coffee or cocoa (or even toasted bread crumbs) are sometimes used for both color and flavor in very dark breads like pumpernickels.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.briess.com/food/Processes/maltclasses.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.briess.com/food/Processes/maltclasses.php</a>|title=Briess Processes - The Classes of Malt Ingredients|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&#60;/ref&#62; The addition of caraway seeds to rye bread is to counter the bloating that can be caused by the high fiber content of rye. Caraway has well-known anti-flatulence properties; however, the association is so long-standing that the flavor combination is now almost inseparable.</p>

<p>A simple, all-rye bread can be made using a sourdough starter and rye meal; it will not rise as high as a wheat bread, but will be more moist with a substantially longer keeping time. Such bread is often known as &#34;black bread&#34; (<i>Schwarzbrot</i> in German, <i>chyorniy khleb</i> in Russian)&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/recipe.jsp?recipe_id=R244" rel="nofollow">Black Bread recipe from master baker Jeffrey Hamelman</a>, roughly in the style of German pumpernickel&#60;/ref&#62; from their darker color than wheat breads (enhanced by long baking times, creating <a href="/Maillard_reaction" title="Maillard reaction">Maillard reactions</a> in the crumb). The German <i>Vollkornbrot</i> (whole-grain bread) is something of an archetypical example, containing both rye meal and cracked whole rye grains (which are generally soaked overnight before incorporating into the dough). It is used both as an appetizer substrate for such things as smoked fish and caviar and as a <a href="/Sandwich_bread" title="Sandwich bread">sandwich bread</a>. A very similar, but darker, bread, German-style pumpernickel, has an even darker color derived from toasted leftover bread and other agents. Due to the density of the bread, the yeast in the starter is used at least as much for the fermentation character in the bread itself as it is for leavening. Danish <i><a href="/Rugbr%C3%B8d" title="Rugbrød">rugbrød</a></i> (rye bread), another archetypical example, is typically made with sour dough, with either straight rye flour or mixed with whole and/or cracked rye kernels. Any breads containing wheat flour are not considered <i>rugbrød</i>, but <i>white bread</i>. A variety of seeds, such as pumpkin, poppy and caraway, may be added for taste. <i>Rugbrød</i> is a staple lunch food, typically eaten topped with cold or warm fish and meats, cheese or any other <a href="/Cold_cut" title="Cold cut">cold cut</a>.</p>
<p>As stated above, all-rye breads may have very long keeping times, measured in months rather than days, and are popular as storage rations for long boat trips and outdoors expeditions. Such breads are usually sliced very thin because of their density, sometimes only a few millimeters thick, and are sometimes sold presliced in this manner.</p>

It is fairly common to combine rye with other grains and seeds. In southern Germany and Switzerland, for example, it is not uncommon to find a variant of <i>Vollkornbrot</i> with <a href="/Sunflower" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds instead of the rye seeds, and some traditional recipes also substitute whole wheat grains for the rye grains.&#60;ref&#62;Robertson, Laurel, et al. <i>The <a href="/Laurel&#39;s_Kitchen" title="Laurel&#39;s Kitchen">Laurel&#39;s Kitchen</a> Bread Book</i>, 2ed.

<p>In <a href="/Medieval_Europe" title="Medieval Europe">medieval Europe</a>, a mixed rye and wheat bread known as &#34;maslin&#34; (or variants of the name) was the bread of the better-off peasants for hundreds of years,&#60;ref&#62;Elizabeth David, <i>English Bread and Yeast Cookery</i>, Penguin Books, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780140467918" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780140467918">ISBN 978-0-14-046791-8</a>&#60;/ref&#62; in contrast to the white <a href="/Manchet" title="Manchet">manchet</a> bread eaten by the rich, and the <a href="/Horsebread" title="Horsebread">horsebread</a> eaten by the poorer peasants, which was made of cheaper grains including <a href="/Oat" title="Oat">oats</a>, <a href="/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a> and <a href="/Pulse_(legume)" title="Pulse (legume)">pulses</a>.</p>

Wheat-rye breads, particularly light rye (sissel) and American pumpernickel, but also a combination known as &#34;marble rye&#34;, are very closely associated with Jewish-American cuisine, particularly the <a href="/Delicatessen" title="Delicatessen">delicatessen</a>. The bulk of the flour is white wheat flour (often a less-refined form known as &#34;first clear&#34;), with a substantial portion of rye mixed in for color and flavor. The dough is often, but not necessarily, leavened, in whole or in part, with sourdough, but sometimes uses a small addition of <a href="/Citric_acid" title="Citric acid">citric acid</a> or <a href="/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> to achieve the lowered pH needed to neutralize the rye amylases; so-called &#34;Jewish rye&#34; is further seasoned with whole caraway seeds and glazed with an egg wash, and is traditionally associated with salted meats such as <a href="/Corned_beef" title="Corned beef">corned beef</a>, <a href="/Pastrami" title="Pastrami">pastrami</a>, and (outside <a href="/Kosher" title="Kosher">kosher</a> circles) <a href="/Ham" title="Ham">ham</a>. High-gluten wheat flour can be used with rye flour to make a dough suitable for <a href="/Bagel" title="Bagel">bagels</a>, as well. Jewish-style American rye bread is sometimes referred to as &#34;corn bread&#34; or &#34;corn rye&#34;; the term comes from the use of cornmeal as a coating and handling aid and does not necessarily imply the use of cornmeal within the dough itself as in rye and Indian.</p>
<p>The Jewish-American variety has Eastern European antecedents, including Russian-style brown bread and <a href="/Riga" title="Riga">Riga</a>-style rye bread.&#60;ref&#62;Von Bremzen, Anya, and John Welchmann, <i>Please to the Table</i>.
