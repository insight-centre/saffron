In everyday usage, a <b>vegetable</b> is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savoury meal. The term &#34;vegetable&#34; is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as <a href="/Fruit" title="Fruit">fruits</a>, <a href="/Nut_(fruit)" title="Nut (fruit)">nuts</a> and <a href="/Cereal" title="Cereal">cereal</a> grains, but includes seeds such as <a href="/Pulse_(legume)" title="Pulse (legume)">pulses</a>. The original meaning of the word <i>vegetable</i>, still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant, as in the terms &#34;vegetable kingdom&#34; and &#34;vegetable matter&#34;.</p>
<p>Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by <a href="/Hunter-gatherer" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherers</a> and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new <a href="/History_of_agriculture" title="History of agriculture">agricultural way of life</a> developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. <a href="/Agriculture_in_China" title="Agriculture in China">China</a> is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from <a href="/Subsistence_agriculture" title="Subsistence agriculture">subsistence farmers</a> supplying the needs of their family for food, to <a href="/Agribusiness" title="Agribusiness">agribusinesses</a> with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing and marketing.</p>
<p>Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and fiber. Many governments encourage their citizens to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.</p>

The word <i><a href="//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vegetable">vegetable</a></i> was first recorded in English in the early 15th century. It comes from <a href="/Old_French" title="Old French">Old French</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;Online Etymology Dictionary&#34;&#62;{{OEtymD|vegetable}}&#60;/ref&#62; and was originally applied to all plants; the word is still used in this sense in biological contexts.&#60;ref name=&#34;swedenborg&#34;/&#62; It derives from <a href="/Medieval_Latin" title="Medieval Latin">Medieval Latin</a> <i>vegetabilis</i> &#34;growing, flourishing&#34; (i.e. of a plant), a semantic change from a <a href="/Late_Latin" title="Late Latin">Late Latin</a> meaning &#34;to be enlivening, quickening&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Online Etymology Dictionary&#34;/&#62; Use of the word for a person  who has an uneventful life originated in 1921 while its use for someone totally lacking in mental and physical capacity dates from 1976.&#60;ref name=&#34;Online Etymology Dictionary&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>The meaning of &#34;vegetable&#34; as a &#34;plant grown for food&#34; was not established until the 18th century.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite book | first=John | last=Ayto | title=Dictionary of Word Origins | publisher=Arcade Publishing | location=New York | year=1993 | isbn=1-55970-214-1 | oclc=33022699}}
&#60;/ref&#62;
In 1767, the word was specifically used to mean a &#34;plant cultivated for food, an edible herb or root&#34;. The year 1955 noted the first use of the shortened, slang term &#34;veggie&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Online Etymology Dictionary&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>As an <a href="/Adjective" title="Adjective">adjective</a>, the word <i>vegetable</i> is used in scientific and technical contexts with a different and much broader meaning, namely of &#34;related to plants&#34; in general, edible or not — as in <i>vegetable matter</i>, <i>vegetable kingdom</i>, <i>vegetable origin</i>, etc.&#60;ref name=&#34;swedenborg&#34;&#62;Swedenborg, Emanuel (2003). <i>Swedenborg Concordance 1888</i>.

<p>The exact definition of a &#34;vegetable&#34; may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide{{spaced ndash}}roots, tubers, bulbs, <a href="/Corm" title="Corm">corms</a>, stems, leaf stems, leaf sheaths, leaves, buds, flowers, fruits and seeds. The broadest definition is the word&#39;s use adjectivally to mean &#34;matter of plant origin&#34; to distinguish it from &#34;animal&#34;, meaning &#34;matter of animal origin&#34;.

Potatoes are not included in the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked.

Vegetables have been part of the human diet from time immemorial. Some are staple foods but most are accessory foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavours and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are <a href="/Perennial_plant" title="Perennial plant">perennials</a> but most are <a href="/Annual_plant" title="Annual plant">annuals</a> and <a href="/Biennial_plant" title="Biennial plant">biennials</a>, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.&#60;ref name=RHS/&#62;</p>
<p>Different soil types suit different crops, but in general in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly in the spring and are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of <a href="/Horticultural_fleece" title="Horticultural fleece">fleece</a>, <a href="/Cloche_(agriculture)" title="Cloche (agriculture)">cloches</a>, <a href="/Plastic_mulch" title="Plastic mulch">plastic mulch</a>, <a href="/Polytunnel" title="Polytunnel">polytunnels</a> and <a href="/Greenhouse" title="Greenhouse">greenhouses</a>.&#60;ref name=RHS&#62;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening |last1=Brickell |first1=Christopher (ed) |year=1992 |type=Print |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-0-86318-979-1 |pages=303–308}}&#60;/ref&#62; In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.&#60;ref name=Field/&#62;</p>

<p>
When a vegetable is harvested, it is cut off from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can be left in the ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm moist surroundings during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading needs to be done to remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness and colour.&#60;ref name=Dixie&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/a0185e/a0185e0a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/a0185e/a0185e0a.htm</a> |title=8.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Storage">Storage</span></h3>
<p>All vegetables benefit from proper post harvest care. A large proportion of vegetables and perishable foods are lost after harvest during the storage period. These losses may be as high as thirty to fifty percent in developing countries where adequate cold storage facilities are not available. The main causes of loss include spoilage caused by moisture, moulds, micro-organisms and vermin.&#60;ref name=&#34;PrakashGarg&#34;&#62;{{cite book|author1=Garg &#38; Prakash|author2=Garg, H.P. |title=Solar Energy: Fundamentals and Applications |url=<a class="external free" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-v_LfcIdJxIC&#38;pg=PA191" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/books?id=-v_LfcIdJxIC&#38;pg=PA191</a> |year=2000 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-463631-2 |pages=191}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

Storage can be short-term or long-term. Most vegetables are perishable and short-term storage for a few days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose <a href="/Moisture" title="Moisture">moisture</a>, and the <a href="/Vitamin_C" title="Vitamin C">vitamin C</a> in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level and to keep the produce in the shade.&#60;ref name=Dixie/&#62;</p>

<p>The objective of preserving vegetables is to extend their availability for consumption or marketing purposes. The aim is to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value, and preserve these qualities for an extended period. The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally-occurring <a href="/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> and the spoilage caused by <a href="/Micro-organism" title="Micro-organism">micro-organisms</a>.&#60;ref name=MAFF/&#62; Canning and freezing are the most commonly used techniques, and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to <a href="/Carotenoid" title="Carotenoid">carotenoids</a>, <a href="/Vitamin_E" title="Vitamin E">vitamin E</a>, <a href="/Dietary_element" title="Dietary element">minerals</a> and <a href="/Dietary_fiber" title="Dietary fiber">dietary fiber</a>.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal |author=Rickman, Joy C. ; Bruhn, Christine M.; Barrett, Diane M. |year=2007 |title=Nutritional comparison of fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables II.

<a href="/Canning" title="Canning">Canning</a> is a process during which the enzymes in vegetables are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used in order to prevent the mechanical breakdown of the product and to preserve the flavour as far as is possible. The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.&#60;ref name=MAFF/&#62;</p>
<p><a href="/Frozen_food" title="Frozen food">Freezing</a> vegetables and maintaining their temperature at below {{convert|-10|°C}} will prevent their spoilage for a short period, whereas a temperature of {{convert|-18|°C}} is required for longer-term storage.

Traditionally, <a href="/Drying_(food)" title="Drying (food)">sun drying</a> has been used for some products such as tomatoes, mushrooms and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain and attack by rodents, birds and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using <a href="/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar powered</a> driers.&#60;ref name=&#34;PrakashGarg&#34;/&#62; The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.&#60;ref name=MAFF/&#62;</p>
