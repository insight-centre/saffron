A <b>Coney Island Hot Dog</b> (or <b>Coney Dog</b> or <b>Coney</b>) is a <a href="/Hot_dog" title="Hot dog">hot dog</a> in a bun topped with a savory meat sauce and sometimes other toppings.

It is largely a phenomenon related to immigration from Greece and the Macedonian region to the United States in the early 20th century.</p>

<p>In 1913 the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce in New York had banned the use of the term &#34;hot dog&#34; on restaurant signs on Coney Island, an action prompted by concerns about visitors taking the term literally and assuming there was dog meat in the sausage.&#60;ref name=&#34;Mariani, John F. 1985&#34;&#62;Mariani, John F., <i>The Dictionary of American Food and Drink</i>, 1985, <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0899191991" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0899191991">ISBN 0899191991</a>, 978-0899191997&#60;/ref&#62; Because of this action by the Chamber of Commerce, immigrants passing through the area didn&#39;t know the sausage in a bun by the American moniker &#34;hot dog.&#34; Instead, the handheld food would have been known to immigrants as a &#34;coney island.&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="First_Instance">First Instance</span></h3>
<p>There is constant debate about when and where the Coney Island hot dog was first served. The earliest known year is 1914, with both Ft. Wayne&#39;s Famous Coney Island Weiner Stand in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and Todoroff&#39;s Original Coney Island in Jackson, Michigan, opening that year. As specific opening dates for those two locations are not known, and it also being unclear if there are other earlier openings at other locations, the first instance of the Coney Island hot dog is yet unknown and no reliable claim can be made.</p>

Ft. Wayne&#39;s Famous Coney Island Weiner Stand was opened in 1914 by three now-unknown Macedonian immigrants. Vasil Eschoff, another Macedonian immigrant, purchased an interest from one of the original owners in 1916.

Wayne&#39;s Famous Coney Island Weiner Stand has the flavor and consistency of a mild peppered savory pork sausage, reflecting its Macedonian heritage. The small hot dog is grilled on a flattop, placed in a steamed bun, yellow mustard applied, then a few teaspoonfuls of the savory chili sauce are added which is then topped with chopped yellow onion.</p>

By 2012 many Albanians began operating them as well.&#60;ref&#62;Yung and Grimm p. <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xCZiDnjmbHQC&#38;pg=PA2" rel="nofollow">2</a>.&#60;/ref&#62; The Greeks established Onassis Coney Island, which has closed.

All three chains sell some Greek food items with Coney dogs.

<p>Popular folklore perpetuates a myth that a Flint coney sauce recipe containing ground beef and ground hot dogs is the &#34;original&#34; Flint Coney sauce recipe.

The actual source of this recipe appears to be an earlier Flint Journal Food Editor, Joy Gallagher, who included the recipe in her column of May 23, 1978. In that column she stated she had included the recipe in an even earlier column. Her apparent source was &#34;a woman who said she was the wife of a chef at the original Coney Island, and that she copied the recipe from his personal recipe book.&#34; Gallagher stated &#34;I believe her&#34;. However, Gallagher also wrote, &#34;I&#39;m not making any claims&#34;. In the same column she also included a second recipe that used beef heart, which she wrote &#34;came to me recently from a reader who swears it is the sauce served at Angelo&#39;s.&#34; The folklore has mixed the supposed sources of the two recipes in this column from Gallagher, with people claiming the ground hot dog recipe is reportedly from Angelo&#39;s.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Angelo&#39;s Coney Island Sauce|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/angelos-coney-island-sauce/167369" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/angelos-coney-island-sauce/167369</a>|website=BigOven.com|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; In his column published in the Flint Journal on April 18, 1995, Food Editor Ron Krueger reported taking Gallagher&#39;s ground hot dog recipe directly to Angelo&#39;s co-owner Tom V.

<p>Jackson style uses a topping of either ground beef or ground beef heart, onions and spices. The Todoroffs&#39; restaurants were some of the earlier locations for Jackson coneys beginning in 1914. However, those locations are now closed. The company currently manufactures and distribute their coney sauce for retail purchase at supermarkets or other restaurants.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|title=Todoroff&#39;s Original Coney Island|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.todoroffs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.todoroffs.com</a>|website=Todoroff&#39;s Original Coney Island|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; There are several other coney restaurants in the area, most notably Jackson Coney Island and Virginia Coney Island, both of which are located on East Michigan Avenue in front of the train station near where the original Todoroff&#39;s restaurant was located. These restaurants all use a blend of onion and spices similar to Todoroff&#39;s but use ground beef heart instead of ground beef for the coney sauce. The Jackson style was late to the usage of beef heart in the sauce, using ground beef prior to converting to ground beef heart in the early 1940s.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|last1=Flory|first1=Brad|title=Brad Flory column: Feeding Jackson&#39;s astonishing appetite for ground beef heart|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.mlive.com/opinion/jackson/index.ssf/2014/06/brad_flory_column_feeding_jack.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlive.com/opinion/jackson/index.ssf/2014/06/brad_flory_column_feeding_jack.html</a>|website=MLive.com|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; Jackson takes their coneys very seriously.
