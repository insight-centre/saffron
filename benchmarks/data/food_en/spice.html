<p>Unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts, it is not practical to <a href="/Breadboard" title="Breadboard">breadboard</a> integrated circuits before manufacture. Further, the high costs of <a href="/Photomask" title="Photomask">photolithographic masks</a> and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built.  Simulating the circuit with SPICE is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit.</p>
<p>Board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing. Even with a breadboard, some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board, such as parasitic resistances and capacitances.  These parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using SPICE simulation. Also, designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances.  In these cases it is common to use SPICE to perform <a href="/Monte_Carlo_method" title="Monte Carlo method">Monte Carlo</a> simulations of the effect of component variations on performance, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Transient_Analysis">Transient Analysis</span></h2>

<p>Since transient analysis is dependent on time, it uses different analysis algorithms, control options with different convergence-related issues and different initialization parameters than DC analysis. However, since a transient analysis first performs a DC operating point analysis (unless the UIC option is specified in the .TRAN statement), most of the DC analysis algorithms, control options, and initialization and convergence issues apply to transient analysis.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Initial_conditions_for_transient_analysis">Initial conditions for transient analysis</span></h3>

<p>Some circuits, such as oscillators or circuits with feedback, do not have stable operating point solutions. For these circuits, either the feedback loop must be broken so that a DC operating point can be calculated or the initial conditions must be provided in the simulation input. The DC operating point analysis is bypassed if the UIC parameter is included in the .TRAN statement. If UIC is included in the .TRAN statement, a transient analysis is started using node voltages specified in an .IC statement. If a node is set to 5 V in a .IC statement, the value at that node for the first time point (time 0) is 5 V.</p>
<p>You can use the .OP statement to store an estimate of the DC operating point during a transient analysis.</p>
<p>&#60;code&#62;</p>
<pre>.TRAN 1ns 100ns UIC
.OP 20ns
</pre>
<p>&#60;/code&#62;</p>
<p>The .TRAN statement UIC parameter in the above example bypasses the initial DC operating point analysis. The .OP statement calculates transient operating point at t = 20 ns during the transient analysis.</p>
<p>Although a transient analysis might provide a convergent DC solution, the transient analysis itself can still fail to converge. In a transient analysis, the error message &#34;internal timestep too small&#34; indicates that the circuit failed to converge. The convergence failure might be due to stated initial conditions that are not close enough to the actual DC operating point values. See the later part of this chapter for a discussion of transient analysis convergence aids.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adoption">Adoption</span></h2>
<p>SPICE inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs, in academia, in industry, and in commercial products.  The first commercial version of SPICE was ISPICE,&#60;ref&#62;Vladimirescu, Andrei, <i>SPICE -- The Third Decade</i>, Proc. 1990 IEEE Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting, Minneapolis, Sept. 1990, pp. 96–101&#60;/ref&#62; an interactive version on a timeshare service, <a href="/National_CSS" title="National CSS">National CSS</a>.  The most prominent commercial versions of SPICE include HSPICE (originally commercialized by <a href="/Ashawna_Hailey" title="Ashawna Hailey">Shawn and Kim Hailey</a> of Meta Software, but now owned by <a href="/Synopsys" title="Synopsys">Synopsys</a>) and <a href="/PSPICE" title="PSPICE">PSPICE</a> (now owned by <a href="/Cadence_Design_Systems" title="Cadence Design Systems">Cadence Design Systems</a>).  The academic spinoffs of SPICE include XSPICE, developed at <a href="/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology" title="Georgia Institute of Technology">Georgia Tech</a>, which added mixed analog/digital &#34;code models&#34; for behavioral simulation, and Cider (previously CODECS, from UC Berkeley/Oregon State Univ.) which added <a href="/Semiconductor_device_modeling" title="Semiconductor device modeling">semiconductor device simulation</a>. The integrated circuit industry adopted SPICE quickly, and until commercial versions became well developed many IC design houses had proprietary versions of SPICE.&#60;ref&#62;K. S.

SPICE combined operating point solutions, transient analysis, and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analyses">Analyses</span></h3>

<p>SPICE2 included these analyses:
</p>
<ul>
<li>AC analysis (<a href="/Linear" title="Linear">linear</a> <a href="/Small_signal_model" title="Small signal model">small-signal</a> frequency domain analysis)</li>
<li>DC analysis (nonlinear <a href="/Quiescent_point" title="Quiescent point">quiescent point</a> calculation)</li>
<li>DC transfer curve analysis (a sequence of nonlinear operating points calculated while sweeping an input voltage or current, or a circuit parameter)</li>
<li>Noise analysis (a small signal analysis done using an adjoint matrix technique which sums uncorrelated noise currents at a chosen output point)</li>
<li><a href="/Transfer_function" title="Transfer function">Transfer function</a> analysis (a small-signal input/output gain and impedance calculation)</li>
<li>Transient analysis (time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since SPICE is generally used to model <a href="/Nonlinear" title="Nonlinear">nonlinear</a> circuits, the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a <a href="/Quiescent_point" title="Quiescent point">quiescent point</a> calculation at which the circuit is linearized. SPICE2 also contained code for other small-signal analyses: <a href="/Sensitivity_analysis" title="Sensitivity analysis">sensitivity analysis</a>, <a href="/Pole%E2%80%93zero_plot" title="Pole–zero plot">pole-zero analysis</a>, and <a href="/Small-signal" title="Small-signal">small-signal</a> <a href="/Distortion" title="Distortion">distortion</a> analysis. Analysis at various temperatures was done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature, allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes.</p>
<p>Other circuit simulators have since added many analyses beyond those in SPICE2 to address changing industry requirements. Parametric sweeps were added to analyze circuit performance with changing manufacturing tolerances or operating conditions. Loop gain and stability calculations were added for analog circuits. <a href="/Harmonic_balance" title="Harmonic balance">Harmonic balance</a> or time-domain steady state analyses were added for RF and switched-capacitor circuit design. However, a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to SPICE has not yet emerged.&#60;ref name=&#34;SPICE4&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>It is very important to use appropriate analyses with carefully chosen parameters. For example, application of linear analysis to nonlinear circuits should be justified separately. Also, application of transient analysis with default simulation parameters can lead to qualitatively wrong conclusions on circuit dynamics.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite journal</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Device_models">Device models</span></h3>
<p>SPICE2 included many semiconductor device <a href="/Transistor_models" title="Transistor models">compact models</a>: three levels of <a href="/MOSFET" title="MOSFET">MOSFET</a> model, a combined <a href="/Ebers-Moll_model" title="Ebers-Moll model">Ebers–Moll</a> and <a href="/Gummel%E2%80%93Poon_model" title="Gummel–Poon model">Gummel-Poon bipolar model</a>, a <a href="/JFET" title="JFET">JFET</a> model, and a model for a <a href="/Diode" title="Diode">junction diode</a>. In addition, it had many other elements: resistors, capacitors, inductors (including <a href="/Inductance#Coupled_inductors" title="Inductance">coupling</a>), independent <a href="/Voltage_source" title="Voltage source">voltage</a> and <a href="/Current_source" title="Current source">current sources</a>, ideal <a href="/Transmission_line" title="Transmission line">transmission lines</a>, active components and voltage and current controlled sources.</p>
<p>SPICE3 added more sophisticated MOSFET models, which were required due to advances in semiconductor technology.
In particular, the <a href="/BSIM" title="BSIM">BSIM</a> family of models were added, which were also developed at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Commercial and industrial SPICE simulators have added many other device models as technology advanced and earlier models became inadequate. To attempt standardization of these models so that a set of model parameters may be used in different simulators, an industry working group was formed, the <a href="/Compact_Model_Council" title="Compact Model Council">Compact Model Council</a>,&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web |url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.geia.org/index.asp?bid=597" rel="nofollow">http://www.geia.org/index.asp?bid=597</a> |title=CMC - Compact Model Council | publisher=GEIA}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&#60;/ref&#62; to choose, maintain and promote the use of standard models.  The standard models today include <a class="external text" href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIM3" rel="nofollow">BSIM3</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIM4" rel="nofollow">BSIM4</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIMSOI" rel="nofollow">BSIMSOI</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://pspmodel.asu.edu/" rel="nofollow">PSP</a>, <a class="external text" href="http://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/iee/eb/hic_new/hic_start.html" rel="nofollow">HICUM</a>, and <a class="external text" href="http://mextram.ewi.tudelft.nl/" rel="nofollow">MEXTRAM</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Input_and_output:_Netlists.2C_schematic_capture_and_plotting">Input and output: Netlists, schematic capture and plotting</span></h3>
<p>SPICE2 took a text <a href="/Netlist" title="Netlist">netlist</a> as input and produced line-printer listings as output, which fit with the computing environment in 1975.  These listings were either columns of numbers corresponding to calculated outputs (typically voltages or currents), or line-printer <a href="/ASCII_art" title="ASCII art">character &#34;plots&#34;</a>.  SPICE3 retained the netlist for circuit description, but allowed analyses to be controlled from a <a href="/Command_line_interpreter" title="Command line interpreter">command-line</a> interface similar to the <a href="/C_shell" title="C shell">C shell</a>.  SPICE3 also added basic <a href="/X_Window_System" title="X Window System">X</a> plotting, as <a href="/UNIX" title="UNIX">UNIX</a> and engineering <a href="/Workstation" title="Workstation">workstations</a> became common.</p>
<p>Vendors and various free software projects have added <a href="/Schematic_capture" title="Schematic capture">schematic capture</a> front-ends to SPICE, allowing a <a href="/Schematic_diagram" title="Schematic diagram">schematic diagram</a> of the circuit to be drawn and the netlist to be automatically generated. Also, <a href="/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">graphical user interfaces</a> were added for selecting the simulations to be done and manipulating the voltage and current output vectors. In addition, very capable graphing utilities have been added to see waveforms and graphs of parametric dependencies. Several free versions of these extended programs are available, some as introductory <a href="/PSpice" title="PSpice">limited packages</a>, and some <a href="/Linear_Technology" title="Linear Technology">without restrictions</a>.</p>
