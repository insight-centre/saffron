<p><b>Seafood</b> is any form of <a href="/Sea_life" title="Sea life">sea life</a> regarded as <a href="/Food" title="Food">food</a> by humans. Seafood prominently includes <a href="/Fish_(food)" title="Fish (food)">fish</a> and <a href="/Shellfish" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a>.
Shellfish include various species of <a href="/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, <a href="/Crustacean" title="Crustacean">crustaceans</a>, and <a href="/Echinoderm" title="Echinoderm">echinoderms</a>. Historically, <a href="/Sea_mammal" title="Sea mammal">sea mammals</a> such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some <a href="/Edible_seaweed" title="Edible seaweed">seaweeds</a> and <a href="/Microalgae" title="Microalgae">microalgae</a>, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the <a href="/Category:Sea_vegetables" title="Category:Sea vegetables">category of sea vegetables</a>). In <a href="/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, although not generally in the <a href="/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the term &#34;seafood&#34; is extended to <a href="/Fresh_water" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a> organisms eaten by humans, so all edible <a href="/Aquatic_life" title="Aquatic life">aquatic life</a> may be referred to as seafood. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.</p>
<p>The harvesting of <a href="/Wild_fisheries" title="Wild fisheries">wild seafood</a> is usually known as <a href="/Fishing" title="Fishing">fishing</a> or <a href="/Hunting" title="Hunting">hunting</a>, and the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as <a href="/Aquaculture" title="Aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, or <a href="/Fish_farming" title="Fish farming">fish farming</a> in the case of fish. Seafood is often distinguished from <a href="/Meat" title="Meat">meat</a>, although it is still animal and is excluded in a strict vegetarian diet. Seafood is an important source of <a href="/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> in many <a href="/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diets</a> around the world, especially in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as <a href="/Fish_food" title="Fish food">fish food</a> to farm other fish or rear farm animals. Some seafoods (<a href="/Kelp" title="Kelp">kelp</a>) are used as food for other plants (<a href="/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>). In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption. Products, such as <a href="/Fish_oil" title="Fish oil">fish oil</a> and <a href="/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)" title="Spirulina (dietary supplement)">spirulina tablets</a> are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).</p>

<p>Fishing scenes are rarely represented in <a href="/Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However, <a href="/Oppian" title="Oppian">Oppian of Corycus</a>, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the <i>Halieulica</i> or <i>Halieutika</i>, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (<a href="/Squid" title="Squid">squid</a>, <a href="/Octopus" title="Octopus">octopus</a>, and <a href="/Shellfish" title="Shellfish">shellfish</a>) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. <a href="/Sardine" title="Sardine">Sardines</a> and <a href="/Anchovy" title="Anchovy">anchovies</a> were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on <a href="/Lake_Copais" title="Lake Copais">Lake Copais</a>, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was <i>skaren</i> (probably <a href="/Parrotfish" title="Parrotfish">parrotfish</a>) whereas <a href="/Atlantic_bluefin_tuna" title="Atlantic bluefin tuna">Atlantic bluefin tuna</a> was three times as expensive.&#60;ref&#62;Dalby, p.67.&#60;/ref&#62; Common salt water fish were <a href="/Yellowfin_tuna" title="Yellowfin tuna">yellowfin tuna</a>, <a href="/Red_mullet" title="Red mullet">red mullet</a>, <a href="/Batoidea" title="Batoidea">ray</a>, <a href="/Swordfish" title="Swordfish">swordfish</a> or <a href="/Sturgeon" title="Sturgeon">sturgeon</a>, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its <a href="/Eel" title="Eel">eels</a>, celebrated by the hero of <i><a href="/The_Acharnians" title="The Acharnians">The Acharnians</a></i>. Other fresh water fish were <a href="/Esox" title="Esox">pike-fish</a>, <a href="/Carp" title="Carp">carp</a> and the less appreciated <a href="/Catfish" title="Catfish">catfish</a>.</p>
<p>Pictorial evidence of <a href="/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> fishing comes from <a href="/Mosaic" title="Mosaic">mosaics</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://museum.agropolis.fr/english/pages/expos/aliments/poissons/images/mosaique.htm" rel="nofollow">Image of fishing illustrated in a Roman mosaic</a>.&#60;/ref&#62; At a certain time the <a href="/Goatfish" title="Goatfish">goatfish</a> was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place <i>in garo</i>, in the <a href="/Garum" title="Garum">sauce</a>. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why <i>mullus</i> in the feast of <a href="/Trimalchio" title="Trimalchio">Trimalchio</a> (see <i>the <a href="/Satyricon" title="Satyricon">Satyricon</a></i>) could be shown as a characteristic of the <i><a href="/Parvenu" title="Parvenu">parvenu</a></i>, who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.</p>
<p>In <a href="/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. <a href="/Kipper" title="Kipper">Kippers</a> made from herring caught in the <a href="/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> could be found in markets as far away as <a href="/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.&#60;ref&#62;Adamson (2002), p. 11.&#60;/ref&#62; While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. <a href="/Stockfish" title="Stockfish">Stockfish</a>, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of <a href="/Mollusca" title="Mollusca">mollusks</a> including <a href="/Oyster" title="Oyster">oysters</a>, <a href="/Mussel" title="Mussel">mussels</a> and <a href="/Scallop" title="Scallop">scallops</a> were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater <a href="/Crayfish" title="Crayfish">crayfish</a> were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most.&#60;ref&#62;Adamson (2004), pp. 45–39.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Modern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of <a href="/Fish_hatchery" title="Fish hatchery">hatcheries</a> and improved techniques of <a href="/Fish_farming" title="Fish farming">fish farming</a> and <a href="/Aquaculture" title="Aquaculture">aquaculture</a>. Better understanding of the <a href="/Shellfish_poisoning" title="Shellfish poisoning">hazards</a> of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.</p>

<p>Fish is a highly <a href="/Decomposition" title="Decomposition">perishable</a> product. The <i>fishy</i> smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of <a href="/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> into <a href="/Polyamine" title="Polyamine">biogenic amines</a> and <a href="/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>.&#60;ref&#62;N.

<p>Live <a href="/Food_fish" title="Food fish">food fish</a> are often transported in tanks at high expense for an <a href="/Live_food_fish_trade" title="Live food fish trade">international market</a> that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="external text" href="http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2005039280&#38;IA=WO2005039280&#38;DISPLAY=DESC" rel="nofollow">WIPO</a>&#60;/ref&#62; While some seafood <a href="/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a> keep live fish in <a href="/Aquarium" title="Aquarium">aquaria</a> for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in <a href="/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 <a href="/Tonne" title="Tonne">tonnes</a> in 2000.

<p>If the <a href="/Cool_chain" title="Cool chain">cool chain</a> has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the <a href="/Shelf_life" title="Shelf life">validity date</a> printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the <a href="/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="Food and Drug Administration (United States)">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a <a href="/Time_temperature_indicator" title="Time temperature indicator">time temperature indicator</a> on certain fresh chilled seafood products.&#60;ref&#62;{{cite web|url=<a class="external free" href="http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2003/ucm147270.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2003/ucm147270.htm</a> |title=La Rosa Logistics Inc 14-Jan-03 |publisher=Fda.gov |accessdate=2012-04-02}}&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Fresh fish is a highly perishable food product, so it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are <a href="/Fish_fillet" title="Fish fillet">filleted</a> and displayed for sale on a bed of <a href="/Crushed_ice" title="Crushed ice">crushed ice</a> or <a href="/Refrigeration" title="Refrigeration">refrigerated</a>.

<p>Long term <a href="/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">preservation</a> of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are <a href="/Stockfish" title="Stockfish">drying</a> and <a href="/Salting_(food)" title="Salting (food)">salting</a>. <a href="/Desiccation" title="Desiccation">Desiccation</a> (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as <a href="/Cod" title="Cod">cod</a>. Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like <a href="/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a> and <a href="/Mackerel" title="Mackerel">mackerel</a>. Fish such as <a href="/Salmon" title="Salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="/Tuna" title="Tuna">tuna</a>, and <a href="/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a> are cooked and <a href="/Canning" title="Canning">canned</a>.

Species of fish that are high on the <a href="/Food_chain" title="Food chain">food chain</a>, such as <a href="/Shark" title="Shark">shark</a>, <a href="/Swordfish" title="Swordfish">swordfish</a>, <a href="/King_mackerel" title="King mackerel">king mackerel</a>, <a href="/Albacore_tuna" title="Albacore tuna">albacore tuna</a>, and <a href="/Tilefish" title="Tilefish">tilefish</a> contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time.

Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting, where practices such as overglazing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. The detection of water retention agents helps identify the fraud and its origin.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}</p>
