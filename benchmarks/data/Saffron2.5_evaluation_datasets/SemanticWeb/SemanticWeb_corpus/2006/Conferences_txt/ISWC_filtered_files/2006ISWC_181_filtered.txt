Abstract. Semantic Web browsers and other tools aimed at displaying RDF data
to end users are all concerned with the same problem: presenting content primarily intended for machine consumption in a human-readable way. Their solutions
differ but in the end address the same two high-level issues, no matter the underlying representation paradigm: specifying (i) what information contained in
RDF models should be presented (content selection) and (ii) how this information should be presented (content formatting and styling). However, each tool currently relies on its own ad hoc mechanisms and vocabulary for specifying RDF
presentation knowledge, making it difficult to share and reuse such knowledge
across applications. Recognizing the general need for presenting RDF content
to users and wanting to promote the exchange of presentation knowledge, we
designed Fresnel as a browser-independent vocabulary of core RDF display con-
cepts. In this paper we describe Fresnels main concepts and present several RDF
browsers and visualization tools that have adopted the vocabulary so far.

1 Introduction

RDF (Resource Description Framework) is designed to facilitate machine interpretability of information and does not define a visual presentation model since human readability is not one of its stated goals. Displaying RDF data in a user-friendly manner is a
problem addressed by various types of applications using different representation para-
digms. Web-based tools such as Longwell [1] (see Figure 1-a) and Piggy-Bank [2] use
nested box layouts, or table-like layouts (e.g. Brownsauce [3], Noadster [4], Swoop [5])
for displaying properties of RDF resources with varying levels of details. Other tools
like IsaViz [6] (see Figure 1-b) and Welkin [7] represent RDF models as node-link di-
agrams, explicitly showing their graph structure. A third approach combines these paradigms and extends them with specialized user interface widgets designed for specific
information items like calendar data, tree structures, or even DNA sequences, providing
advanced navigation tools and other interaction capabilities: Haystack [8] (see Figure
1-c), mSpace [9] and Tabulator [10].

Such applications are confronted with the same two issues, independently of the underlying representation paradigm and interface capabilities: selecting what content to
show and specifying how to format and style this content. Each application takes its
own approach and defines its own vocabulary to specify how to present data to users.
As with other kinds of knowledge, we believe that being able to share what we consider presentation knowledge makes sense in the context of the Semantic Web and that
being able to exchange and reuse presentation knowledge between browsers and other
visualization tools will benefit both programmers and end users. However, the current
diversity of approaches and vocabularies for representing this knowledge makes such
exchange and reuse difficult at best, if not impossible.

1.1 Related Work

Early RDF visualization tools rendered RDF models in a predefined, non-customizable
way [3]. Recent tools provide more flexible visualizations that can be customized by
writing style sheets, transformations, or templates, following either a declarative or a
procedural approach.

Procedural approaches consider the presentation process as a series of transformation
steps. One such approach consists in using XSLT to transform RDF graphs encoded as
RDF/XML trees in an environment such as Cocoon [11]. Authoring XSLT templates
and XPath expressions to handle arbitrary RDF/XML is complex, if not impossible,
considering the many potential serializations of a given RDF graph and the present lack
of a commonly accepted RDF canonicalization in XML [12]. This problem has been
partly addressed by Xenon [13], an RDF style sheet ontology that builds on the ideas of
XSLT but combines a recursive template mechanism with SPARQL as an RDF-specific
selector language. Xenon succeeds in addressing XSLTs RDF canonicalization problem but still has a drawback common to all procedural approaches, that transformation
rules are tied to a specific display paradigm and output format, thus preventing the reuse
of presentation knowledge across applications.

Declarative approaches are based on formatting and styling rules applied to a generic
representation of the content. They can be compared to XHTML+CSS, which has been
successful for the classic Web. The Haystack Slide ontology [14], used to describe
how Haystack display widgets are laid out, is one example. Another is IsaVizs Graph
Style Sheets [15], which modifies the formatting, styling, and visibility of RDF graph

E. Pietriga et al.

elements represented as node-link diagrams. The main drawback of the declarative approaches developed so far is that they make strong assumptions about, and are thus tied
to, the specific display paradigm for which they have been developed and are therefore
unlikely to be meaningful across different representation paradigms.

1.2 Toward the Specification of Presentation Knowledge

Providing a single global view of all the information contained in an RDF model is
often not useful. The mass of data makes it difficult to extract information relevant to
the current task and represents a significant cognitive overload for the user. From an
abstract perspective, the first step of the presentation process thus consists in restricting
the visualization to small but cohesive parts of the RDF graph, similarly to views in
the database world. But identifying what content to show is not sufficient for making
a human-friendly presentation from the information. To achieve this goal, the selected
content items must be laid out properly and rendered with graphical attributes that favor
legibility in order to facilitate general understanding of the displayed information. Relying solely on the contents structure and exploiting knowledge contained in the schema
associated with the data is insufficient for producing sophisticated presentations and
visualizations. The second step thus consists in formatting and styling selected content
items.

Fresnels goal is to provide an RDF vocabulary to encode information about how to
present Semantic Web content to users (i.e., what content to show, and how to show
it) as presentation knowledge that can be exchanged and reused between browsers and
other visualization tools. However, we do not expect all applications, which do not necessarily rely on the same representation paradigms and formats, to exchange and reuse
all formatting and styling instructions as some might not be appropriate for all para-
digms. We therefore identified a set of core presentation concepts that are applicable
across applications and which form the core modules of Fresnel. One of the design
goals of these modules was to make them easy to learn and use, but also easy to implement in order to promote their adoption by many applications. On top of these modules,
we have also begun to define additional Fresnel vocabulary items which are grouped in
extension modules. The remainder of this article mainly focuses on the core selection
and formatting modules. More information about extension modules can be found in
the Fresnel User Manual [16].

2 Core Vocabulary Overview

Fresnel is an RDF vocabulary, described by an OWL ontology [16]. Fresnel presentation knowledge is thus expressed declaratively in RDF and relies on two foundational
concepts: lenses and formats (see Figure 2). Lenses specify which properties of RDF
resources are shown and how these properties are ordered while formats indicate how to
format content selected by lenses and optionally generate additional static content and
hooks in the form of CSS class names that can be used to style the output through external CSS style sheets. The following sections introduce the main vocabulary elements
using the examples in Figures 3 and 4.
?

Fig. 2. Fresnel foundational concepts

Figure 3 shows a simple lens and associated formats used to present information
about a person described with the FOAF vocabulary [17]. This figure also shows a
possible rendering of such a resource, that a browser like Horus [18] or Longwell [1]
could produce. Examples use the Notation 3 syntax [19].

2.1 Content Selection

The domain of a lens indicates the set of resources to which a lens applies (line 301: the
lens applies to instances of class foaf:Person). Property fresnel:showProperties
is used to specify what properties of these resources to show and in what order (lines
302-308). In this example, the values of both fresnel:classLensDomain and fres-
nel:showProperties are basic selectors, which take the form of plain URIs (rep-
resented here as qualified names), respectively identifying the class of resources and
property types to select. More advanced selection expressions can be written using either FSL or SPARQL. They make it possible to associate lenses with untyped RDF re-
sources, which do occur in real-world models since rdf:type properties are not manda-
tory. They can also be used to specify that a lens should display all properties of a given
namespace, or any other complex selection condition(s) that can be represented by an
FSL or SPARQL expression (see Section 3).

Fresnel Core provides additional constructs for specifying what properties of resources to display. The special value fresnel:allProperties is used when the list
of properties that can potentially be associated with resources handled by a lens is unknown to the lens author but should nevertheless be displayed. When it appears as a
member of the list of properties to be shown by a lens, fresnel:allProperties designates the set of properties that are not explicitly designated by other property URI
references in the list, except for properties that appear in the list of properties to hide
(fresnel:hideProperties). Two other constructs are used to handle the potential
irregularity of RDF data stemming from the fact that different authors might use similar terms coming from different vocabularies to make equivalent statements. Sets of
such similar properties can be said to be fresnel:alternateProperties. For in-
stance, foaf:depiction, foaf:img and p3p:image could be considered as providing

the same information about resources displayed by a given lens. A browser using this
lens would try to display the resources foaf:depiction. If the latter did not exist,
the browser would then look for foaf:img or p3p:image (see lines 305-307). Such
knowledge can also be represented through ontology mapping mechanisms, but Fresnel provides this alternative as the ontology layer should not be made a requirement of
the Fresnel presentation process. The other construct, fresnel:mergeProperties, is
used to merge the values of related properties (e.g. foaf:homepage and foaf:work-
Homepage) into one single set of values that can later be formatted as a whole.

The presentation of property values is not limited to a single level, and (possibly
recursive) calls to lenses can be made to display details about the value of a property.
Lenses used in this context are referred to as sublenses. Modifying the example of
Figure 3, we specify in Figure 4 that the browser should render values of the property
foaf:knows (lines 405-407) using another lens (PersonLabelLens, lines 410-413).
The FSL expression (see Section 3) on line 406 specifies in an XPath-like manner that
only values of foaf:knows that are instances of foaf:Person should be selected.

The sublens mechanism implies that a lens can recursively call itself as a sublens for
displaying property values. In order to prevent infinite loops caused by such recursive
calls, Fresnel defines a closure mechanism that allows Fresnel presentation designers to
specify the maximum depth of the recursion.

2.2 Content Formatting

The default layout of selected information items is highly dependent on the browsers
representation paradigm (e.g. nested box layout, node-link diagrams, etc.), but the final
rendering can be customized by associating formatting and styling instructions with
elements of the representation.

Fig. 4. An example of a lens using another lens to display some property values

Formats apply to resources, or to properties and their values, depending on the specified domain. The three example formats of Figure 3 apply respectively to the properties
foaf:name, foaf:mbox and foaf:depiction (lines 310, 313, 318). Formats can be
used to set properties labels (lines 311, 314, 319). Property fresnel:label does not
specify a particular layout but simply gives a text string that can be used to identify the
property. Labels might already be defined for many properties (e.g., in the associated

E. Pietriga et al.

vocabulary description using rdfs:label), but such labels are not guaranteed to exist.
Moreover, a given label might not always be the most appropriate depending on the
context in which the property is displayed. For instance, the default label associated
with property foaf:name in the FOAF schema is name. When displaying the persons
known by the current person in Figure 4, this default label is replaced by Friends (line
426) so as to indicate the appropriate interpretation of the corresponding foaf:name
property values in this context. The customization of labels also proves useful when
displaying property values that are not direct properties of the current resource, as is
made possible by the use of SPARQL or FSL expressions such as:

foaf:knows/*[airport:iataCode/text() = CDG]/foaf:name

which would require an explanatory label such as Friends that leave near Paris.

Formats can also give instructions regarding how to render values. For instance, line
315 indicates that foaf:mbox values should be rendered as clickable links (email ad-
dresses). Values of foaf:depiction should be fetched from the Web and rendered as
bitmap images (line 320).

Property values can be grouped, and additional content such as commas and an ending period can be specified to present multi-valued properties (line 316: inserting a
comma in-between each email address). CSS class names can also be associated with
the various elements being formatted. These names appear in the output document and
can be used to style the output by authoring and referencing CSS style sheets that use
rules with the same class names as selectors.

2.3 Lens and Format Grouping

Lenses and formats can be associated through fresnel:Groups so that browsers can
determine which lenses and formats work together. Fresnel groups are taken into account by browsers when selecting what format(s) to apply to the data selected by a
given lens, as several formats might be applicable to the same property values.

Figure 4 illustrates the use of Fresnel groups to display different labels for the
foaf:name property depending on the context in which the property is shown: the
property is labeled Name when displayed in the context of the PersonLens lens, but is
labeled Friends when displayed in the context of the PersonLabelLens lens. This is
achieved by associating the PersonLens (lines 400-409) and the nameFormat (lines
414-417) to one group: FOAFmainGroup, and by associating the PersonLabelLens
(lines 410-413) and the friendsFormat (lines 424-427) to a second group: FOAFsub-
Group.

A Fresnel group can also serve as a placeholder for formatting instructions that apply to all formats associated with that group, thus making it possible to factorize the
declarations. It is also typically used to declare group-wide data, relevant to both lenses
and formats, such as namespace prefix bindings.

3 Fresnel Selectors

Selection in Fresnel occurs when specifying the domain of a lens or format and when
specifying what properties of a resource a lens should show. Such selection expressions
?

?

?
identify elements of the RDF model to be presented; in other words, specific nodes and
arcs in the graph. As we expect selection conditions to be of varying complexity, we
allow them to be expressed using different languages in an attempt to balance expressive
power against ease of use.

3.1 Basic Selectors

The simplest selectors, called basic selectors, take the form of plain URI references
as shown in section 2. Depending on whether they are used as values of fresnel:
instanceLensDomain or fresnel:classLensDomain, these URI references are
interpreted respectively either as:

 URI equality constraints (the resource to be selected should be identified by this

URI),

 or type constraints (the resources to be selected should be instances of the class

identified by this URI).

Basic selectors are also used to identify properties, which are used for instance as

values of fresnel:showProperties or fresnel:alternateProperties.

Basic selectors are easy to use but have very limited expressive power. For instance,
they cannot be used to specify that a lens should apply to all instances of class foaf:
Person that are the subject of at least five foaf:knows statements. More powerful
languages are required to express such selection constraints.

3.2 Languages for Complex Selection Expressions

Fresnel presentation designers can use two different languages for expressing complex
selection expressions. The first option is the SPARQL query language for RDF [20].
In the context of Fresnel, SPARQL queries must always return exactly one result set,
meaning that only one variable is allowed in the querys SELECT clause. Figure 5-a
gives an example of a lens whose domain is defined by a SPARQL expression. Alter-
natively, designers who prefer a more XPath-like approach, which proved to be a welladapted selector language for XSLT, can use the Fresnel Selector Language (FSL). FSL
is a language for modeling traversal paths in RDF graphs, designed to address the specific requirements of a selector language for Fresnel. It does not pretend to be a full
so-called RDFPath language (contrary to XPR [21], an extension of FSL) but tries to
be as simple as possible, both from usability and implementation perspectives. FSL is
strongly inspired by XPath [22], reusing many of its concepts and syntactic constructs
while adapting them to RDFs graph-based data model. RDF models are considered
directed labeled graphs according to RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [23]. FSL is
therefore fully independent from any serialization. A lens definition using two FSL expressions is shown in Figure 5-b. More information about FSL, including its grammar,
data model and semantics is available in the FSL specification [24].

Applications implementing Fresnel are required to support basic selectors, and we expect a reasonable share of them to support the two other languages: SPARQL is gaining

momentum as a W3C recommendation, and four open-source Java implementations of
FSL are already available1 for HPs Jena Semantic Web Toolkit2, for IsaViz (providing
a visual FSL debugger) and for different versions of the Sesame RDF database3.

4 Implementations

Fresnel has been designed as an application- and output format-independent RDF presentation vocabulary. In this section we give an overview of various applications implementing Fresnel: Longwell [1] and Horus [18] which both render RDF data as HTML
Web pages using nested box layouts, IsaViz [6] which represents RDF graphs as nodelink diagrams, and Cardovan, a browser and lens editor based on the SWT GUI toolkit.

Longwell is a Web-based RDF browser whose foundational navigation paradigm is
faceted browsing. Faceted browsing displays only the properties that are configured
to be facets (i.e., to be important for the user browsing data in one or more specific
domains) using values for those fields as a means for zooming into a collection by
selecting those items with a particular field-value pair.

The latest version of Longwell relies on the SIMILE Fresnel rendering engine, a Java
library built on the Sesame triple store. The engine implements all of the Fresnel core
vocabulary and the portion of the extended vocabulary relating to linking groups to CSS
stylesheets as well as the option of using FSL as a selector language. The Fresnel engine
output consists solely of an XML representation of the Fresnel lenses and formats as
they apply to one resource. Longwell then applies an XSLT transformation to the XML
to generate XHTML. The default XSLT stylesheet shipped with Longwell will generate
a traditional nested box layout, as Horus does, but the stylesheet can be modified by
XSLT developers to change the model as they see fit.

The left side of Figure 6 shows the rendering of a foaf:Organization resource
using a lens that gives some details about the organization and lists its constituent mem-
bers, all foaf:Persons, each listed with their corresponding nickname information to
assist in identification.

Fig. 6. Displaying a view of an organization (left) and a constituent member (right) in Longwell

The nickname list for each person is preceded by the string aka: , added to the
display by using the fresnel:contentFirst directive. The list is also comma sep-
arated, accomplished by setting fresnel:contentAfter to a comma. Clicking on
a URI in the display brings the user to that URI; clicking on a textual label changes
Longwells focus to the resource represented by that label.

On the right side of Figure 6, the focus is on one specific member of the organization
featured in the left side. A sublens is used to generate office contact details, and the
same sublens used in the organization focus (left image) to describe an organizations
members is used in the person focus (right image) to describe who this person claims
to know.

Horus is an RDF browser that displays RDF information using a nested box layout. The
browser provides a simple navigation paradigm for selecting RDF resources and allows
users to switch between different lenses for rendering the resources. Horus supports
Fresnel lenses and formats, which can be associated together using Fresnel groups.
Groups can refer to external CSS style sheets which are used to define fonts, colors and
borders. Horus supports basic selectors, but does not offer SPARQL and FSL as selector
languages. Horus is implemented using PHP and is backed by a MySQL database.
Applying a lens to an RDF resource results in an intermediate tree, which is formatted
afterwards using the formats that are associated to the group of the selected lens. The
ordered and formatted intermediate tree is then serialized into XHTML.

Figure 7 shows two different views on the same person in Horus. The view on the
left uses a lens that displays many details about persons. The sentence This person knows the following people is a custom label for property foaf:knows. The
disclaimer That a person knows somebody does. . .  is static content added using
property fresnel:contentLast. Some of the links are formatted as external links
(fresnel:value formatting instruction set to fresnel:externalLink), while others refer to RDF resources in the knowledge base, and thus have a different rendering.

E. Pietriga et al.

Fig. 7. Two different views on the same person in Horus: detailed view (left), friends view (right)

On the right side of Figure 7, the same person is shown using a different lens. This
lens displays less details about the person itself, but refers to a second lens (used as a
sublens) for displaying details about other persons known by this person. As the sublens belongs to a different group, another CSS class is used to style the names of the
persons friends.

IsaViz is an RDF authoring environment representing RDF models as node-link dia-
grams. The interpretation of Fresnel in IsaViz is inspired by both Generalized Fisheye
Views [25] and Magic Lenses [26]. Fresnel lenses, in conjunction with the formats associated with them through groups, are considered as genuine lenses that modify the
visual appearance of objects below them.

Figure 8 (left) shows the default rendering of a region of an RDF model containing a
foaf:Person resource. At this level of magnification, only a few of the many property
values associated with the resource are visible. Users need to navigate in the graph in
order to get to the values of properties, which can be cumbersome. Alternatively, users
can select a Fresnel lens from the list of available lenses loaded in IsaViz through the
graphical user interface. The selected lens is then tied to the mouse cursor, and when the
lens hovers over a resource that matches its domain, the resources visual appearance
gets modified according to the lens and associated format(s). Resources that match the
selected lens domain are made visually prominent by rendering all other nodes and all
arcs using shades of gray with minimum contrast. When the lens hovers over a resource,
properties selected by the lens are temporarily rendered with highly-contrasted vivid
colors and brought within the current view, closer to the main resource and reordered
clockwise according to the ordering of properties in the lens definition, as illustrated in
Figure 8 (right). Property values revert back to their original state when the lens moves
away from the resource. All these visual modifications, including color and position
changes, are smoothly animated thanks to the underlying graphical toolkits animation
capabilities [27], thus keeping the users cognitive load low following the principles of
perceptual continuity.

Fresnel core formatting instructions are interpreted as customizations of the original
layout and rendering of nodes and links in the diagram. For instance, nodes representing foaf:image property values can be rendered by fetching the actual image from the
?

?

?
Web, as illustrated in Figure 8 (right). The default labels of nodes and arcs can be
customized using fresnel:label instructions. In case a resource is the subject of
multiple statements involving the same property or properties defined as fresnel:
mergeProperties, the arcs and nodes representing these statements can be merged
as a single arc and node with all values within that node, optionally separated by text
as specified in fresnel:contentBefore, fresnel:contentAfter and related formatting instructions.

Cardovan is IBMs implementation of Fresnel lenses (see Figure 9). Written in Java,
Cardovan renders lenses with the SWT graphical user interface toolkit. Cardovan is
similar to other implementations in that it uses a subset of CSS to specify the layout of
lens components on the screen. A remarkable feature of Cardovan is that it allows users
to modify a lens in place. Users can add new properties to the lens, modify property
values, and rearrange the physical layout of the properties displayed, though it is not

a full WYSIWYG Fresnel lens designer. The project is still in its early stages, but is
functional and is already being used for internal projects at IBM.

5 Conclusion

We have given an overview of Fresnel, a browser-independent, extensible vocabulary
for modeling Semantic Web presentation knowledge. Fresnel has been designed as a
modularized, declarative language manipulating selection, formatting, and styling concepts that are applicable across representation paradigms and output formats. We have
presented applications implementing Fresnel core modules while based on different
representation and navigation paradigms, thus substantiating the claim that Fresnel can
be used to model presentation knowledge that is reusable across browsers and other
Semantic Web visualization tools.

Although core modules have been frozen for the time being, the Fresnel vocabulary remains a work in progress as new extension modules meeting special needs are
being developed (e.g., for describing the purpose of lenses and for editing informa-
tion). Extension modules are not necessarily aimed at being application- and paradigm-
independent, as they might not be relevant in all cases; but their inclusion in Fresnel
provides users with a unified framework for modeling presentation knowledge. Another
field for future work is enabling Fresnel formats and lenses to be retrieved transparently
from the Web so that RDF browsers could query the Web for display knowledge about
previously unknown vocabularies.

The development of Fresnel is an open, community-based effort and new contributors are welcome to participate in it. More information can be found on its Web site
http://www.w3.org/2005/04/fresnel-info/.
