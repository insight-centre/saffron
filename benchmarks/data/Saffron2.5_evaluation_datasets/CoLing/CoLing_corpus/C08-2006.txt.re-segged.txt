Abstract
We present SMMR , a scalable sentence
scoring method for query-oriented up-
date summarization . Sentences are scored thanks to a criterion combining query relevance and dissimilarity with already read documents ( history ). As the amount of data in history increases , non-redundancy is prioritized over query-relevance . We show that SMMR achieves promising results on the DUC 2007 update corpus.
1 Introduction
Extensive experiments on query-oriented multidocument summarization have been carried out over the past few years . Most of the strategies to produce summaries are based on an extraction method , which identifies salient textual segments , most often sentences , in documents . Sentences containing the most salient concepts are selected , ordered and assembled according to their relevance to produce summaries ( also called extracts ) ( Mani and Maybury , 1999).
Recently emerged from the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) 2007 marization attempts to enhance summarization when more information about knowledge acquired by the user is available . It asks the following question : has the user already read documents on the topic ? In the case of a positive answer , producing an extract focusing on only new facts is of interest . In this way , an important issue is introduced : c ? 2008.

Document Understanding Conferences are conducted since 2000 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ), http://www-nlpir.nist.gov redundancy with previously read documents ( history ) has to be removed from the extract.
A natural way to go about update summarization would be extracting temporal tags ( dates , elapsed times , temporal expressions ...) ( Mani and Wilson , 2000) or to automatically construct the timeline from documents ( Swan and Allan , 2000). These temporal marks could be used to focus extracts on the most recently written facts . However , most recently written facts are not necessarily new facts.
Machine Reading ( MR ) was used by ( Hickl et al ., 2007) to construct knowledge representations from clusters of documents . Sentences containing ? new ? information ( i.e . that could not be inferred by any previously considered document ) are selected to generate summary . However , this highly efficient approach ( best system in DUC 2007 update ) requires large linguistic resources.
(Witte et al , 2007) propose a rule-based system based on fuzzy coreference cluster graphs . Again , this approach requires to manually write the sentence ranking scheme . Several strategies remaining on postprocessing redundancy removal techniques have been suggested . Extracts constructed from history were used by ( Boudin and Torres-Moreno , 2007) to minimize history?s redundancy.
(Lin et al , 2007) have proposed a modified Maximal Marginal Relevance ( MMR ) ( Carbonell and Goldstein , 1998) reranker during sentence selection , constructing the summary by incrementally reranking sentences.
In this paper , we propose a scalable sentence scoring method for update summarization derived from MMR . Motivated by the need for relevant novelty , candidate sentences are selected according to a combined criterion of query relevance and dissimilarity with previously read sentences . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 and Section 3 presents experiments and evaluates our approach.
2 Method
The underlying idea of our method is that as the number of sentences in the history increases , the likelihood to have redundant information within candidate sentences also increases . We propose a scalable sentence scoring method derived from MMR that , as the size of the history increases , gives more importance to non-redundancy that to query relevance . We define H to represent the previously read documents ( history ), Q to represent the query and s the candidate sentence . The following subsections formally define the similarity measures and the scalable MMR scoring method.
2.1 A query-oriented multidocument summarizer We have first started by implementing a simple summarizer for which the task is to produce query-focused summaries from clusters of documents.
Each document is preprocessed : documents are segmented into sentences , sentences are filtered ( words which do not carry meaning are removed such as functional words or common words ) and normalized using a lemmas database ( i.e . inflected forms ? go ?, ? goes ?, ? went ?, ? gone ?... are replaced by ? go ?). An N - dimensional term-space ? , where N is the number of different terms found in the cluster , is constructed . Sentences are represented in ? by vectors in which each component is the term frequency within the sentence . Sentence scoring can be seen as a passage retrieval task in Information Retrieval ( IR ). Each sentence s is scored by computing a combination of two similarity measures between the sentence and the query . The first measure is the well known cosine angle ( Salton et al ., 1975) between the sentence and the query vectorial representations in ? ( denoted respectively ~ s and ~ Q ). The second similarity measure is based on the JaroWinkler distance ( Winkler , 1999). The original JaroWinkler measure , denoted JW , uses the number of matching characters and transpositions to compute a similarity score between two terms , giving more favourable ratings to terms that match from the beginning . We have extended this measure to calculate the similarity between the sentence s and the query Q:
JW e ( s,Q ) = ? ? q?Q max m?S ?
JW(q,m ) (1) where S ? is the term set of s in which the terms m that already have maximized JW(q,m ) are removed . The use of JW e smooths normalization and misspelling errors . Each sentence s is scored using the linear combination:
Sim ~
Q ) + (1? ?) ? JW e ( s,Q ) (2) where ? = 0.7, optimally tuned on the past DUCs data (2005 and 2006). The system produces a list of ranked sentences from which the summary is constructed by arranging the high scored sentences until the desired size is reached.
2.2 A scalable MMR approach
MMR reranking algorithm has been successfully used in query-oriented summarization ( Ye et al , 2005). It strives to reduce redundancy while maintaining query relevance in selected sentences . The summary is constructed incrementally from a list of ranked sentences , at each iteration the sentence which maximizes MMR is chosen:
MMR = argmax s?S [ ? ? Sim ? (1? ?) ? max s j ? E
Sim j ) ] (3) where S is the set of candidates sentences and E is the set of selected sentences . ? represents an interpolation coefficient between sentence?s relevance and non-redundancy . Sim j ) is a normalized Longest Common Substring ( LCS ) measure between sentences s and s j . Detecting sentence rehearsals , LCS is well adapted for redundancy removal.
We propose an interpretation of MMR to tackle the update summarization issue . Since Sim
Sim abilities even though they are not . Just as rewriting (3) as ( NR stands for Novelty Relevance):
NR = argmax s?S [ ? ? Sim + (1? ?) ? (1? max s h ? H
Sim h )) ] (4)
We can understand that (4) equates to an OR combination . But as we are looking for a more intuitive AND and since the similarities are independent , we have to use the product combination . The double maximization criterion in which the best ranked sentence will be the most relevant to the query AND the most different to the sentences in
H .
SMMR(s ) = Sim ? ( 1? max s h ? H
Sim h ) ) f(H ) (5)
Decreasing ? in (3) with the length of the summary was suggested by ( Murray et al , 2005) and successfully used in the DUC 2005 by ( Hachey et al , 2005), thereby emphasizing the relevance at the outset but increasingly prioritizing redundancy removal as the process continues . Similarly , we propose to follow this assumption in SMMR using a function denoted f that as the amount of data in history increases , prioritize non-redundancy ( f(H )? 0).
3 Experiments
The method described in the previous section has been implemented and evaluated by using the
DUC 2007 update corpus tions present details of the different experiments we have conducted.
3.1 The DUC 2007 update corpus
We used for our experiments the DUC 2007 update competition data set . The corpus is composed of 10 topics , with 25 documents per topic . The update task goal was to produce short (?100 words ) multidocument update summaries of newswire articles under the assumption that the user has already read a set of earlier articles . The purpose of each update summary will be to inform the reader of new information about a particular topic.
Given a DUC topic and its 3 document clusters : A (10 documents ), B (8 documents ) and C (7 documents ), the task is to create from the documents three brief , fluent summaries that contribute to satisfying the information need expressed in the topic statement.
1. A summary of documents in cluster A.
2. An update summary of documents in B , under the assumption that the reader has already read documents in A.

More information about the DUC 2007 corpus is available at http://duc.nist.gov/.
3. An update summary of documents in C , under the assumption that the reader has already read documents in A and B.
Within a topic , the document clusters must be processed in chronological order . Our system generates a summary for each cluster by arranging the high ranked sentences until the limit of 100 words is reached.
3.2 Evaluation
Most existing automated evaluation methods work by comparing the generated summaries to one or more reference summaries ( ideally , produced by humans ). To evaluate the quality of our generated summaries , we choose to use the ROUGE 2004) evaluation toolkit , that has been found to be highly correlated with human judgments . ROUGE-N is a ngram recall measure calculated between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries . In our experiments ROUGE1, ROUGE2 and ROUGE-SU4 will be computed.
3.3 Results
Table 1 reports the results obtained on the DUC 2007 update data set for different sentence scoring methods . cosine + JW e stands for the scoring method defined in (2) and NR improves it with sentence reranking defined in equation (4).
SMMR is the combined adaptation we have proposed in (5). The function f(H ) used in SMMR is the simple rational function , where H increases with the number of previous clusters ( f(H ) = 1 for cluster A , for cluster B and for cluster C).
This function allows to simply test the assumption that non-redundancy have to be favoured as the size of history grows . Baseline results are obtained on summaries generated by taking the leading sentences of the most recent documents of the cluster , up to 100 words ( official baseline of DUC ). The table also lists the three top performing systems at DUC 2007 and the lowest scored human reference.
As we can see from these results , SMMR outperforms the other sentence scoring methods . By ways of comparison our system would have been ranked second at the DUC 2007 update competition . Moreover , no postprocessing was applied to the selected sentences leaving an important margin of progress . Another interesting result is the high performance of the non-update specific method ( cosine + JW e ) that could be due to the small size

4 Discussion and Future Work
In this paper we have described SMMR , a scalable sentence scoring method based on MMR that achieves very promising results . An important aspect of our sentence scoring method is that it does not requires reranking nor linguistic knowledge , which makes it a simple and fast approach to the issue of update summarization . It was pointed out at the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answering and query-oriented summarization have been converging on a common task . The value added by summarization lies in the linguistic quality . Approaches mixing IR techniques are well suited for query-oriented summarization but they require intensive work for making the summary fluent and coherent . Among the others , this is a point that we think is worthy of further investigation.
