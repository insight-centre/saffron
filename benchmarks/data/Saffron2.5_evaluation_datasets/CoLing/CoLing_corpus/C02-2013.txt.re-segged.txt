In this paper , we focus on the domain ontology acquisition from Chinese corpus by extracting rules designed for Chinese phrases  . These rules are noun sequences with part-of -speech tags  . 
Experiments show that this process can construct domain ontology prototypes efficiently and effectively  . 
1. Introduction
Domain ontology is important for largescale natural language application systems such as speech recognition  ( Flett & Brown 2001 )  , question answering ( QA ) , knowledge management and organization memory ( KM/OM )  , information retrieval , machine translation ( Guarino 1998) , and grammar checking systems ( Bredenkamp 2000) . With the help of domain ontology , software systems can perform better in understanding natural language  . 
However , building domain ontology is laborious and time consuming  . 
Previous works suggest that ontology acquisition is an iterative process which includes keyword collection as well as structure reorganization  . The ontology will be revised , refined , and filled in detail during iteration .   ( Noy and McGuinness 2001 ) For example ( Hearst 1992 )  , in order to find a hyponym of a keyword , the human editor must observe sentences containing this keyword and its related hyponyms  . The editor then deduces rules for finding more hyponyms of this keyword  . As such cycle iterates , the editor refines the rules to obtain better quality pairs of keyword-hyponyms  . 
In this work we try to speed up the above labor -intensive approach by designing acquisition rules that can be applied recursively  . 
A human editor only has to verify the results of the acquisition  . 
The extraction rules we specified are templates of part-of-speech  ( POS ) tagged phrase structure . 
Parsing a phrase by POS tags ( Abney 1991 ) is a wellknown shallow parsing technique , which provides the natural language processing function for different natural language applications including ontology acquisition  ( Maedche and Staab 2000 )  . 
In previous works ( Hsu et al 2001) , we have constructed a knowledge representation framework  , InfoMap , to integrate various linguistic knowledge , common sense knowledge and domain knowledge . InfoMap is designed to perform natural language understanding  . It has been applied to many application domains , such as QA system and KM/OM ( Wu et al 2002 ) and has obtained encouraging results . An important characteristic of InfoMap is to extract events from a sentence by capturing the topic words  , usually noun-verb ( NV ) pairs or noun-noun ( NN ) pairs , which is defined in domain ontology . We design the SOAT as a semiautomatic domain ontology acquisition tool following the ontology framework  , InfoMap . 
We shall review the InfoMap ontology framework in section  2  . The domain ontology acquisition process and extraction rules will be discussed in Section  3  . Experimental results are reported in section 4 . We conclude our work in
Section 5.
2. The InfoMap Framework
Gruber defines an ontology to be a description of concepts and relationships  ( Gruber 1993 )  . 
Our knowledge representation scheme , InfoMap , can serve as an ontology framework . InfoMap provides the knowledge necessary for understanding natural language related to a certain knowledge domain  . Thus , we need to integrate various linguistic knowledge  , common sense knowledge and domain knowledge in making inferences  . 
2.1 The Structure of InfoMap
InfoMap consists of domain concepts and their associated attributes  , activities , etc . , which are its related concepts . Each of the concepts forms a treelike taxonomy . InfoMap defines ? reference ? nodes to connect nodes on different branches  , thereby integrating these concepts into a semantic network  . 
InfoMap not only classifies concepts , but also classifies the relationships among concepts  . 
There are two types of nodes in InfoMap : concept nodes and function nodes  . The root node of a domain is the name of the domain  . 
Following the root node , topics are found in this domain that may be of interest to users  . These topics have subcategories that list related subtopics in a recursive fashion  . 
2.2 Function Nodes in InfoMap
InfoMapuses function nodes to label different relationships among related concept nodes  . The basic function nodes are : category , attribute , synonym , and activity , which are described below . 
1 . Category : Various ways of dividing up a concept A  . For example , for the concept of ? people ? , we can divide it into young , mid-age and old people according to ? age ? . Another way is to divide it into men and women according to ? sex ?  , or rich and poor people according to ? wealth ? , etc . For each such partition , we shall attach a ? cause ? . Each such division can be regarded as an angle of viewing concept A  . 
2 . Attribute : Properties of concept A . For example , the attributes of a human being can be the organs  , the height , the weight , hobbies , etc . 
3 . Associated activity : Actions that can be associated with concept A  . For example , if A is a ? car ? , then it can be driven , parked , raced , washed , repaired , etc . 
4 . Synonym : Expressions that are synonymous to concept A in the context  . 
2.3 The Contextual View of InfoMap
Generally speaking , an ontology consists of definitions of concepts , relations and axioms . A wellknown ontology , WordNet ( Miller 1990) , has the following features : hypernymy , hyponymy , antonymy , semantic relationship , and synset . Comparing with the globlal view of concepts in WordNet  , InfoMap defines category , event , atttibute , and synonym in a more contextual fashion . For example , the synonym of a concept in InfoMap is valid only in this particular context  . This is very different from the synset in WordNet  . Each node B underneath a function node ( synonym , attribute , activity or category ) of A can be treated as a related concept of A and can be further expanded by describing other relations pertaining to B  . However , the relations for B described therein will be ? limited under the context of A ?  . For example , if A is ? organization ? and B is the ? facility ? attribute of A  , then underneath the node B we shall list those facilities one can normally find in an organization  , whereas for the ? facility ? attribute of ? hotel  ?  , we shall only list those existing facilities in hotel  . 
2.4 The Inference Engine of InfoMap
The kernel program can map a natural language sentence into a set of nodes and uses the edited knowledge to recognize the events in the user?s sentences  . Technically , InfoMap matches a natural language sentence to a collection of concept notes  . There is a firing mechanism that finds nodes in InfoMap relevent to the input sentence  . Suppose we want to find the event of the following sentence : ? How do I invest in stocks ?? and the interrogative word ? how ? can fire the word ? method ?  . Then along the path from ? method ? to ? stock ? the above sentence has fired the concepts ? stock ? and ? invest ?  . 
Thus , the above sentence will correspond to the path : stock-event-invest-attribute-method Given enough knowledge about the events related to the main concept  , InfoMap can be used to parse Chinese sentences . Readers can refer to ( Hsu et al 2001 ) for a thorough description of InfoMap . 
3 . Automatic Domain Ontology Acquisition To build an ontology for a new domain  , we need to collect domain keywords and find the relationships among them  . An acquisition process , SOAT , is designed that can construct a new ontology through domain corpus  . Thus , with little human intervention , SOAT can build a prototype of the domain ontology . 
As described in previous sections , InfoMap consists of two major relations among concepts  , i . e . , Taxonomic relations ( category and synonym ) and Non-taxonomic relations ( attribute and event )  . We defined sentence templates , which consists of patterns of keywords and variables  , to capture these relations . 
3.1 Description of SOAT
Given the domain corpus with the POS tag , our
SOAT can be described as follows.
Input : domain corpus with the POS tag
Output : domain ontology prototype
Steps : 1 Select a keyword ( usually the name of the domain ) in the corpus as the seed to form a potential root set R  2 Begin the following recursive process : 2  . 1 Pick a keyword A as the root from R2 . 2 Find a new related keyword B of the root A by extraction rules and add it into the domain ontology according to the rules  . 
2 . 3 If there is no more related keywords , remove A from R2 . 4 Put B into the potential root set 2 . 5 Repeat step 2 , until either R becomes empty or the total number of nodes generated exceeds a prescribed threshold  . 
We find that most of the domain keywords are not in the dictionary  . So the traditional TF/IDF method would fail . Instead , we use the high frequency new words discovered by PAT-tree as the seeds  . Ideally , SOAT can generate andomain ontology prototype automatically  . 
However , the extraction rules need to be refined and updated by a human editor  . The details of SOAT extraction rules are in Section  3  . 2 . 
3.2 The Extraction Rules of SOAT
The extraction rules in Tables 1 ,  2 , 3 and 4 , consists of a specific noun as the root , and the POS tags of the neighboring words . A rule is a linguistic template for finding keywords related to the root  . The target of extraction is usually a word or a compound word  , which has strong semantic links to the root . Our rules are especially effective in identifying essential compound words for a specific domain  . 
We use POS tags defined by CKIP ( CKIP 1993) , in which Na is the generic noun , Nb is the proper noun , and Nc is the top on ym . Generally , an N a can be a subject or an object in a sentence  , including concrete noun and abstract noun , such as ? cloth ? , ? table ? , ? tax ? , and ? technology ? . An Nc is the name of a place . Readers can refer to CKIP ( CKIP 1993 ) for more information about the POS tag . In our experiment , we focus on Na and Nc , because the topics that we are interested in usually fall in these two categories  . The extraction rules of finding categorical ( taxonomy ) relationships from a given Na ( or Nc ) are in Table 1 ( and 3 )  . The rules of finding attribute ( non-taxonomy ) relationships from a given Na ( or Nc ) are in Table 2 ( and 4 )  .

Li and Thompson ( 1981 ) describe Mandarin Chinese as a Topic-prominent language in which the subject or the object is not as obvious as in other languages  . Therefore , the highly precise shallow parsing result ( Munoz et al 1999 ) on NN and SV pairs in English is probably not applicable to Chinese  . 
4.1 The Experiment of Extraction Rate
To test the qualitative and quantitative performance of SOAT  , we design two experiments . We construct three domain ontology prototypes for three different domains and corpora  . Table 5 shows the result in which the frequently asked questions  ( FAQs ) for stocks are taken from test sentences of the financial QA system  . The university and bank corpora are collected from the CKIP corpus  ( CKIP 1995 )  . 
We select sentences containing the keyword ? University ? or ? Bank ? as the domain corpora  . 
The results in Table 5 show that SOAT can capture related keywords and the relationships among them from limited sentences very efficiently without using the frequency  .

The first corpus is a collection of FAQ sentences about computer network  . The second corpus is a collection of sentences containing the keyword ? network ? from the CKIP corpus  . The third corpus is the collection of sentences from Windows  2000 online help document . To reduce the cost of human verification , we limit the size of corpus to 275 sentences . The result in Table 6 shows that there is a tradeoff between extraction rate and the accuracy rate  .

Domain Ontology Editor for QA System
SOAT can help in QA system ontology editing.
In our experience , a trained knowledgeable editor can compile about 100 FAQs into our ontology manually per day . On the other hand , with the help of SOAT , a knowledgeable editor can edit on the average 4 categories ,   25 attributes and 42 activities that SOAT extracted . 

The quantity is estimated on 4* ( 25+42 ) = 268 FAQ query concepts at least . Thus , the productivity of using SOAT is approximated 268% times . It is obvious that SOAT can help reducing the cost of building a new domain ontology  . 
5. Conclusion
We present a semiautomatic process of domain ontology acquisition from domain corpus  . The ontology schema we used is general enough for different applications and specific enough for the task of understanding the Chinese natural language  . The main objective of the research is to extract useful relationships from domain articles to construct domain ontology prototypes in a semiautomatic fashion  . The SOAT extraction rules we developed can identify keywords with strong semantic links  , especially those compound words in the domain . 
We have discussed how to extract related NN pairs in Section  3 for SOAT . However , the extraction rules for NN pairs do not apply for NV pairs  . In the future we shall follow the approach in ( Tsai et al 2002 ) to extract the relationships between nouns and its related verbs  . 
The main restriction of SOAT is that the quality of the corpus must be very high  , namely , the sentences are accurate and abundant enough to include most of the important relationships to be extracted  .
