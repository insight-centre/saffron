Abstract
Existing algorithms for the Generation of Referring Expressions tend to generate distinguishing descriptions at the semantic level , disregarding the ways in which surface issues can affect their quality . This paper considers how these algorithms should deal with surface ambiguity , focussing on structural ambiguity . We propose that not all ambiguity is worth avoiding , and suggest some ways forward that attempt to avoid unwanted interpretations . We sketch the design of an algorithm motivated by our experimental findings.
1 Introduction
A Noun Phrase ( np ) is a referring expression if its communicative purpose is to identify an object to a hearer . The Generation of Referring Expressions ( gre ) is an integral part of most Natural Language Generation ( nlg ) systems ( Reiter and Dale , 2000). The gre task can informally be stated as follows . Given an intended referent ( i.e ., the object to be identified ) and a set of distractors ( i.e ., other objects that can be confused with the referent ), find a description that allows a hearer to identify its referent uniquely ( Dale , 1992). Such a description is called a Distinguishing Description ( dd ). In practice , however , most gre algorithms build sets of semantic properties available in a Knowledge Base ( kb ), rather than descriptions in natural language ; surface issues are often ignored ( exceptions are : ( Stone and ?

Webber , 1998; Krahmer and Theune , 2002;
Siddharthan and Copestake , 2004)). This is an important limitation , for example because ambiguities can be introduced in the step from properties to language descriptions . Such ? surface ambiguities ? take centerstage in this paper . More specifically , we shall be investigating situations where they lead to referential ambiguity , that is , unclarity as to what the intended referent of a referring expression is.
Example 1: Consider a scenario in which there are sheep and goats along with other animals , grazing in a meadow ; some of the sheep and goats are black while others are either brown or yellow . Suppose our task is to single out the black sheep and black goats from the rest of the animals . Suppose an algorithm has generated the logical form ( Black ? Goats ), which could be realised as either the black sheep and the black goats or , more briefly , as the black sheep and goats . The latter np expresses two nonequivalent logical formulae : ( i ) ( Black ? Sheep ) ? Goats , and ( ii ) ( Black ? Sheep ) ? ( Black ? Goats ). Since both formulae correspond with a set of animals in the domain , referential ambiguity can result.
On the other hand , the black sheep and goats is shorter and possibly more fluent . This example highlights the possible tension between brevity and lack of ambiguity . The question facing us in this paper is how to balance them.
This paper examines how gre should deal with structural ambiguity , focussing on ambiguity of the form the Adj Noun1 and Noun2, also known as coordination ambiguity . We call referring expressions of this form scopally ambiguous , as the scope of Adj is unclear between wide scope ( Adj applies to both nouns ) and narrow scope ( Adj applies only to Noun1).

In this paper , we use set-theoretic operators instead of logical connectives to represent logical forms.
433 2 Approach
A cursory view of corpora such as the British National Corpus ( bnc ) reveals that there are many instances of coordination ambiguity : 1. the black cats and dogs 2. the bearded men and women 3. the old men and women in the hats Psycholinguistic evidence suggests that , in many cases , these ambiguities could cause confusion for a hearer ( Tanenhaus and Trueswell , 1995). Hence , it seems justifiable to have gre avoid such kind of ambiguities . However , it also seems plausible that some readings may be very unlikely . For example , in (2) a wide-scope reading is , arguably , very unlikely . Abney and others have argued that every sentence is potentially ambiguous between many parses , even though we may not even notice this ambiguity ( Abney , 1996; Wasow et al , 2005). This suggests that , in gre as well , it might not be feasible to avoid all referential ambiguities all the time , and that the choice of referring expression should sometimes involve a balancing act in which degree of ambiguity is balanced against other properties of the generated expression , such as its length or fluency.
Building on earlier work by Inui et al ( Inui et al , 1992), Neumann ( Neumann , 1994) suggested a general generate-parse-revise model for nlg , based on a reversible grammar . His generator generates a string which is then parsed to detect any structural ambiguities . If a string is found to be ambiguous then revision is used to produce an alternative , non-ambiguous string instead ( if such a string exists ). The likelihood of the different interpretations is not taken into account , however.
Our approach to the problem is to find out the likelihood of each interpretation of an np , and to tailor gre to avoid all distractor interpretations ( i.e ., interpretations that can be confused with the intended one ) as suggested in ( van Deemter , 2004). An interpretation can be confused with the intended one if it is more likely or almost as likely as the intended one . The problem is , how to determine the likelihood of different interpretations.
3 Getting likelihood from the bnc
In scopally ambiguous referring expressions , there is a tension between wide - and narrow-scope interpretations . This can be viewed in terms of two competing forces : a Coordination Force , whereby Noun1 and Noun2 attract each other to form a syntactic unit , and a Modification Force , whereby Adj and Noun1 attract each other to form a syntactic unit . Computational linguists have proposed using language corpora to estimate the likelihood of an interpretation ( Wu and Furugori , 1998; Chantree et al , 2006). Chantree et al used information from the Sketch Engine database ( Kilgarriff , 2003) operating on the bnc to resolve coordination ambiguity . The Sketch Engine contains grammatical triples in the form of Word Sketches for each word , with each triple accompanied by a salience value indicating the likelihood of occurrence of the word with its argument in a grammatical relation . Word Sketches summarise the words ? grammatical and collocational behavior.
Chantree et al gathered a dataset of ambiguous phrases from a corpus of requirements specifications , and collected human judgements about their interpretations . They then used machine learning techniques combined with various heuristics to determine the most likely interpretation of a coordination . They identified two heuristics as particularly useful.
One was the Coordination-Matches Heuristic : if a coordination between two head nouns occurs ( at all ) within the corpus , then a wide-scope reading is likely . The other was the Collocation-Frequency Heuristic : if a modifier is collocated more frequently with the nearest head word than with the head word further away , then a narrow-scope reading is likely.
The best performance was achieved by combining the two heuristics : wide-scope reading is likely if Coordination-Matches heuristic gives a positive result and Collocation-Frequency heuristic gives a negative result . We decided to modify Chantree et al?s approach in two ways and apply the modified approach to nlg.
Firstly , it seemed unlikely to us in the general case that the deciding factor is always whether two words cooccur at all . We therefore decided to separate cooccurence percentages into ones that are very high and ones that are very low . Secondly , we observed that Chantree et al take Coordination Force into account when they predict wide scope , but not be more systematic ? and more useful to an nlg system , which has to cope with all possible inputs ? to consider all four combinations , of strong and weak , coordination and modification force . We define that there will be a Strong Coordination Force ( SCF ) if the collocational frequency between the two nouns is high , and a Weak Coordination Force ( WCF ) otherwise . Similarly , we define that there will be a Strong Modification Force ( SMF ) if the collocational frequency of Adj is high with Noun1 and low with Noun2, and a Weak Modification Force ( WMF ) otherwise.
After a preliminary investigation of the data , we decided to operationalise high collocational frequency between two words as meaning that either of the two words appears among the top 30% collocates of the other word in a grammatical relation ( of interest ); low collocational frequency means that neither of the two words appears among the top 70% collocates of the other word in a grammatical relation . The hypotheses resulting from the above changes are investigated in the following section.
4 Empirical Studies
We conducted three experiments . The first two experiments ask what interpretation of a scopally ambiguous np is the most plausible , thereby testing our generalisation of Chantree?s hypotheses . Knowing how an np is interpreted is useful for an nlg system but not sufficient , because ambiguity needs to be traded off against other factors . For this reason , our third experiment asks which of several nps are preferred by a reader.
4.1 Interpreting nps
We use all four possible combinations of coordination and modification forces to predict an interpretation of a scopally ambiguous referring expression ( see Table1). An SMF would make a wide-scope reading highly unlikely ( cf.
(Wu and Furugori , 1998)). For instance , in the bearded men and women there is an SCF and an SMF , but in fact this phrase would be interpreted as a narrow-scope reading because of the scarcity of bearded women . On the other hand , a WMF could be in favor of a wide-scope reading . We expect that human readers would opt for wide - and narrow-scope readings according to Table 1.
Table 1: Predicting an interpretation
Hypothesis 1: SCF ? SMF ? NS
Hypothesis 2: SCF ? WMF ? WS
Hypothesis 3: WCF ? SMF ? NS
Hypothesis 4: WCF ? WMF ? WS
WS : Wide scope ; NS : Narrow scope
To test these hypotheses , we conducted two interpretation experiments , and rather than asking expert linguists to annotate the strings , we examined how ordinary readers interpret structurally ambiguous strings . In these experiments , given a referential domain and an English np which attempts to identify a subset of objects in the domain , participants were asked to find the referent set of the np.
4.1.1 Experiment 1
In this experiment , referential domains were constructed using real photographs of animals with some of the features printed alongside each photograph . Features were printed because 1) in a pilot study , we observed that some participants had difficulty in discerning some features in some of the photographs , and 2) we attribute some unusual features to some objects , e.g ., we attributed cats with the feature barking although cats don?t bark in reality . Two pairs of nouns were used : one with SCF , and the other with WCF . For each pair of nouns , four different adjectives were used : two with SMF , and two with WMF . A trial in this experiment consists of a set of 9 pictures ( placed in a 3 x 3 grid ), and an English np underneath these pictures . A sample trial is shown in Figure 1. Participants ? task was to remove the pictures ( by mouse clicks on the pictures ) that were referred to by the np . A removed picture was immediately replaced by a blank rectangle ( of the same size).
In each trial , we made sure that both wide-and narrow-scope readings are applicable . For example , for the instruction Please , remove the red lions and horses , in the domain there were 2 red lions , 2 red horses , and some ( at least one ) non-red horses . If a participant removes 2 red lions and 2 red horses , we count it as a wide-scope reading . However , if ( s)he removes all the horses we count it as a narrow-scope reading . We also used 8 fillers , which do not contain a coordination in the np ( e.g ., the dogs on the left ). 60 self-reported native or fluent speakers of English , students from various UK universities , did the experiment on the web.

Results and Discussion : Results were analysed according to whether a participant opted for a wide - or narrow-scope reading . The participants ? responses are shown in Table 2. A twotailed sign binomial test was used to calculate statistical significance . The data indicate that word distribution information can reliably predict a wide-scope reading . However , our predictions for a narrow-scope reading are not confirmed . This may have been because of an intrinsic bias in favour of wide-scope interpretations . Another potential problem with the experiment is that some of the nps shown to participants were rather unusual , involving bearded women , etc . Although the printed features underneath the pictures forced participants to take these unusual cases seriously , the clash between the picture ( of a woman ) and the printed feature (? bearded ?) that arose in such cases may have made participants ? responses unreliable . To avoid this problem we now turn to an experimental setup where we use Euler diagrams instead of iconic pictures.
4.1.2 Experiment 2
This experiment mirrors experiment 1, but we used Euler diagrams instead of pictures paper , we ascertained that no important differences existed between the two groups of subjects . Focussing on Experiment 1, for example , no significant difference in the percentages of wide scope interpretations was found between native speakers and subjects who were merely fluent in English.

Participants received a mini-tutorial on our version of Euler diagrams , where shaded areas denote the sets to which an NP might refer . The purpose of this tutorial was to make sure that the participants understand the semantics of these diagrams . A sample trial is shown in Figure 2 ( where we expect that participants would remove the diagram on the right , which is counted as a wide-scope response ). 60 self-reported native or fluent speakers of English , students from various UK universities , took part in this webbased experiment.

Results and Discussion : Results were recorded according to whether a participant opted for a wide - or narrow-scope reading . The participants ? responses are shown in Table 3.
A twotailed sign binomial test was used to calculate statistical significance of the results.
This time , all four hypotheses are confirmed.
We also observed , however , that in scopally ambiguous expressions , a narrow-scope reading tends to be particularly frequent in the extreme case where Adj has a zero cooccurrence with Noun2 ( in the bnc ). We note that these results are in line with Chantree et al A critic might argue that the problem that was noted in connection with Experiment 1 applies to Experiment 2 as well , because it shows diagrams involving a ? problematic ? in-

The fact that women ( arguably ) cannot be bearded could cause subjects to reject these diagrams ( choosing the other diagram instead , as in the diagram included in Fig . 3, which does not involve such an intersection ). We would argue , however , that this does not cause an unwanted bias . The scarcity of bearded women is a legitimate reason for subjects to believe that a diagram that asserts their existence cannot be a proper interpretation of ? bearded men and women ?; it is just one of the many things that the corpus-based approach captures indirectly , without representing it explicitly . It is equally applicable to expressions like ? handsome men and women ?, where the corpus tells us that ? handsome ? and ? women ? do not go together well ( even though one probably would not say they do not exist).
We have seen that Word Sketches can make reasonable predictions concerning the likelihood of the different interpretations of the nps.
But an np that is clear ( i.e ., not likely to be misunderstood ) may have other disadvantages.
For example , it may lack fluency or it may be perceived as unnecessarily lengthy . For this reason , we also conducted an additional experiment in which we tested readers ? preferences.
4.2 Choosing the best np
The question of how to choose between different nps could be approached in a number of different ways : asking hearers which of several descriptions they prefer , asking hearers to rate several descriptions , measuring interpretation effort ( time ), measuring hearers ? errors etc .. We conducted a readers ? preference experiment where participants were asked to compare pairs of natural language descriptions of one and the same target set , selecting the one they found more appropriate . Brief descriptions took the form the Adj Noun1 and Noun2. Non-brief descriptions took the forms the Adj Noun1 and the Noun2 ( for NS ) and the Adj Noun1 and the Adj Noun2 ( for WS ). A description is said to be clear if its predicted reading is the same as the intended one . By definition a non-brief description is always clear.
Each description could either be brief or not (? b ) and also clear or not (? c ) ( but not (? b , ? c ), as this combination is not applicable in the present setting ). We expected to find that : Hypothesis 5: (+ c,+b ) descriptions are preferred over ones that are (+ c,?b).
Hypothesis 6: (+ c,?b ) descriptions are preferred over ones that are (? c,+b).
4.2.1 Experiment 3
In this experiment , referential domains were represented using Euler diagrams . In each trial , participants were shown an Euler diagram , with some of its area filled to indicate the target referent . They were also shown two English nps , which attempted to identify the filled area . A sample trial , where the intended reading is narrow scope , is shown in Figure 3. Each hypothesis was tested under two con-Figure 3: Sample Trial : Choosing the best np ditions : 1) where the intended reading ( IR ) was WS ; and 2) where the IR was NS . The 4 comparisons thus corresponded to 4 conditions ( where PR stands for predicted reading):

C2. IR = NS & PR = NS (+ c,+b ) vs . (+ c,?b)

Results and Discussion : Results were coded according to whether a participant?s choice was ? b and/or ? c . Table 4 displays response proportions . A twotailed sign binomial test was used to calculate statistical significance of the results . The results confirm our hypotheses in all conditions , being highly statistically significant ( p < 0.001).

It is also important to note that it is the Modification Force which is the deciding factor for a particular reading . Moreover , other things being equal , brief descriptions are preferred over longer ones . Since Experiment 2 ( and , to an extent , Experiment 1) confirmed our hypotheses , we could have based our algorithm on these . As was noted in section 4.1.2, however , our data also suggest a slight modification of Hypotheses 1 and 3, because a preference for narrow scope existed mainly when the Adjective and the second Noun cooccurred very rarely . Therefore , we shall use a modified version of Strong Modification Force ( SMF):
SMF ? will mean that Adj and Noun2 have zero ( rather than below 30%) cooccurrence in the bnc.
5 Applying results to gre
In this section , we show how the results of the previous sections can be exploited in gre.
The patterns explored in the above correspond to disjunctive plural references . Disjunction is required whenever there is no conjunction of atomic properties that sets the elements of a set of referents apart from all the other objects in the domain . Recall example 1 ( from ?1), where the aim is to single out the black sheep and black goats from the rest of the animals . This task cannot be performed by a simple conjunction ( i.e ., of the form ? the X ?, where X contains adjectives and nouns only ), so disjunctions become unavoidable.
Various proposals have been made for allowing gre algorithms to produce referring expressions of this kind ( Stone , 2000; van
Deemter , 2002; Gardent , 2002; Horacek , 2004). Here we take as our starting point the approach of ( Gatt , 2007) ( henceforth Gatt?s Algorithm with Partitioning or gap ). gap is the only algorithm that produces a dd in Disjunctive Normal Form ( dnf ) while also guaranteeing that every ? part ? of the partition contains a noun . The dnf takes the form:
S n , where each S i itself expresses a conjunction of atomic properties . ( For example , S this approach : the first , purely formal extension ensures that a set of such logical formulae is generated , rather than just one formula ; all of these formulae are unambiguous , and logically equivalent with each other ; but they all map to different strings of words . This is because we assume a very direct Linguistic Realisation strategy in which , for example , (( Black ? Sheep ) ? Goats ) is worded as the black sheep and goats ; syntactic ambiguity results from the lack of brackets in the English np . The second , empirically based extension is to choose the ? best ? element of the set ( of formulae ) by making use of our experimental outcomes so as to balance clarity and brevity.
Since our predictions are based on words , we propose a model that constructs descriptions from words and in which the description building process is driven by words . We compute the extension ( where the extension of a word w consists of all objects to which w applies ) of a potentially ambiguous word by unifying the extensions of all its interpretations.
Let p n be the properties that a word w can express . Then the extension of w is : [[ w ]] = i=n ? i=1 [[ p i ]] (1) In what follows , a domain consists of a set D of objects , and a set P of properties applicable to objects in D . Given a set of target referents
R ? D , the proposed algorithm will : ? lexicalise each p ? P into words ; Lexicalisation takes a property as input and that property . For example , a property , say , aged will be realised as ( a set of ) words { old , aged , senior}.
? build a dd in dnf using words , where the extension of a word is computed as indicated in equation 1. Each S i must contain a head noun . For example , in the scenario presented in Example 1 under ?1, it would produce a dd like : ( black ? sheep ) ? ( black ? goats).
? apply transformation rules on the dd to construct a set of dds that are logically equivalent to the dd . ( See below .) ? realise each description in the set as English nps using appropriate syntax . Each description is realised as one and only one np , using the above realisation strategy.
? determine the most likely reading of each np , by making use of Word Sketches.
? select the np that is optimal given our empirical findings . ( See below .) Transformation Rules : In connection with reference to sets , it has been proposed to use the QM algorithm ( McCluskey , ) to find the shortest formula equivalent to a given input formula ( van Deemter , 2002). In the present setting , the shortest formula might lead to a confusing np after linguistic realisation . For example , the formula Black ? ( Cats ? Dogs ) might be realised as the black cats and dogs , which could easily be misunderstood as ( Black ? Cats ) ? Dogs . For this purpose , we propose to use a set of transformation rules that allow us to find a set of formulae logically equivalent to the original formula ; the aim is to make the set large enough that all the relevant expressive choices ( as investigated in this paper ) are represented . In particular , we need the following rules that operate on dnfs ( where A is an adjective ; B combinations of adjectives and nouns).
1. (( A ? B 2. ( X ? Y ) ? ( Y ? X)
After application of these transformation rules , the original description ? ( i.e ., the formula produced by an algorithm such as gap ) is replaced by a set of formulae F all of whose elements are logically equivalent to ?. The elements of F are then realised as nps . The clarity of each np is determined as follows ( where PR and IR stand for predicted reading and intended reading , respectively).
If SMF ? then PR is NS
Else If WMF then PR is WS
Else PR is { NS , WS}
EndIf
If ( PR = IR ) then NP is clear
Else NP is unclear
EndIf
If , after transformations , several of the resulting descriptions are clear then the choice between them needs to be taken on other grounds . To do this , we give preference to the shortest of all descriptions that are clear ( measured in terms of number of words in the np).
If ties still arise then we suggest that fluency is taken into account , for example by preferring np whose structure is most frequent in the bnc . This procedure will often result in nps that are ? clear ? even though they are syntactically ambiguous.
Example 2: Let the domain be represented as : { man(e young(e is to single out { e the entities . First , properties are lexicalised into words . Suppose the relevant words are the ones in the list Q = ? man , woman , old , young ?. Then , the algorithm takes each word w ? Q in turn and constructs a dd : ( old ? man ) ? ( old ? woman ). The transformation rules then produce { old?(man?woman ), old ? ( woman?man ), ( old?man )? ( old?woman ), ( old?woman )? ( old?man )}. These formulae are realised as : (1) the old men and women , (2) the old women and men , (3) the old men and the old women and (4) the old women and the old men . The nps (1) and (2) are structurally ambiguous , but the Word Sketches rule out the unintended reading of both nps ( with narrow scope for the adjective ), so they are both clear.
The nps (3) and (4) are structurally unambiguous . All nps are therefore clear , but (1) and (2) are preferred because they are shorter than (3) and (4). Corpus frequency suggests that the tie between (1) and (2) is resolved by opting for the more frequent pattern (1).
6 Conclusions and future work
We highlighted that structural ambiguity , which is often ignored in the gre could cause dealt with . Based on psycholinguistic evidence that avoidance of all ambiguity is hard , we suggested an approach that avoids referring expressions that have distractor interpretations.
We did : (1) interpretation experiments and found that Word Sketches can be used to make distractor interpretation precise ; and (2) an experiment with human readers that trades-off clarity and brevity . A gre algorithm is sketched that balances these factors based on our experimental findings.
We aim to extend this work in two directions . First , we hypothesise that our approach can help nlg systems handle other surface ambiguities , for instance involving PP-attachment . Second , we realise that contextual factors are likely to affect people?s interpretive and generative inclinations . Therefore , in light of the work reported in this paper , it would be interesting to explore the effect of cooccurrences in a given text upon the interpretation of nps occurring later in that same text , since the effect of such earlier occurrences on readers ? interpretation could conceivably ? drown out ? the generic likelihoods based on Word Sketches that have formed the main subject matter of this paper.
