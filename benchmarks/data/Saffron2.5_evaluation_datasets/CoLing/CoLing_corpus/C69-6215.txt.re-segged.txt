Computational Studies in Terminology
( Abstract of a Paper to be Presented at the 1969
International Congress on Computational Linguistics  , 
SAnga S ~ by , Sweden)
Terminology , as a field of applied linguistics , is gaining increasing importance , since in recent years striking new developments of technology and the sciences have taken place  . Terminologists have their own international congresses  ; linguists and standard associations try to build up and control the specific vocabularies of all different fields  , in order to have them compiled and printed in up -to-date dictionaries  . Industry also shows remarkable interest in this work  , because those great international companies heav ily depend on the means of a fixed and standardized vocabulary in order to achieve the necessary communication  ( to go along with its products )  , either by publication or by translation . 
For various reasons , the task of documenting and controlling the growth and structure of terminological vocabularies cannot satisfactorily be accomplished without the application of computers  . Insight into the structure of terminologies has been gained by functional ~ computer prepared statistics of vocabularies and validations of texts  . Linguists , for their part , have programmed computers in order to isolate relevant lexical items from terminological texts ~ as well as to determine the various meanings and shades of meaning of specific terms ~ by means of special procedures  . 
Several linguistic methods and procedures ~ as originally developed for automatic sentence analysis and mechanical translation ~ can successfully be employed in the field of computer assisted research and control of terminologies This holds especially true with regard to automated compilation procedures  , as to be used within the process of preparing bilingual and multiling u ~ l technical dictionaries  .
