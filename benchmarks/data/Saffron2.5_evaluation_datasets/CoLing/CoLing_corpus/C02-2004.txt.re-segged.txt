We describe a discovery program , called
UNIVAUTO ( UNI Versals AU thoring TOol) , whose domain of application is the study of language universals  , a classic trend in contemporary linguistics . Accepting as input information about languages , presented in terms of feature-values , the discoveries of another human agent arising from the same data  , as well as some additional data , the program discovers the universals in the data , compares them with the discoveries of the human agent and  , if appropriate , generates a report in English on its discoveries . Running
UNIVAUTO on the data from the seminal paper of Greenberg  ( 1966 ) on word order universals , the system has produced several linguistically valuable texts  , two of which are published in a refereed linguistic journal  . 
1 Introduction
Previous works in machine scientific discovery have mostly focussed on historical reconstruction  ( work culminating in the book by Langle yet . al .  1987) , but more recent efforts are directed towards designing programs that discover new scientific knowledge  . Such systems operate in disciplines as diverse as mathematics  , chemistry , astronomy , medicine or linguistics . The field is currently very active ( for recent developments , cf . e . g . the special issues on discovery of the journals Artificial Intelligence  , April 1997 or Foundations of
Science 1999; the ECAI-98 Workshop on
Discovery , The International Conferences on Discovery Science  , Japan , 1998 and 1999) . 
In this paper , we present UNIVAUTO ( UNI Versals AU thoring TOol ) , a system whose domain of application is linguistics  , and in particular , the study of language universals , a classic trend in contemporary linguistics . This trend was initiated by the pioneering paper of Joseph Greenberg  ( 1966 )  , investigating word order in a database of 30 languages of wide genetic and a real coverage , described in terms of 15 ordering features . Greenberg discovered a number of universals relating diverse ordering properties of languages  , and h is example was followed by attempts at similar generalizations at other linguistic levels or across levels  ( for a review of the state-of-the-art , cf . e . g . Croft 1990) . 
UNIVAUTO was run on various datasets ( word order , phonology , morphosyntax ) , with very promising linguistic results . The published outcomes of UNIVAUTO so far include : two whole journal articles Pericliev  ( 1999 ,  2000 ) based on data from Greenberg ( 1966 )   ( with no postediting , the first one with no disclosure of articles ?" machine origin "  )  ; around 50 statistically significant phonological universals based on Maddieson?s  UPSID-451 database , published without postediting at the Universals Archive at the University of Konstanz  ; the substance discovery ( rather than verbalization ) part of Pericliev ( 2002 )  . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first computer program to generate a whole scientific article  . 
2 Overview of UNIVAUTO
Below is a brief description of UNIVAUTO ( UNI Versals AU thoring TOol )  , drawing for illustration on data from Greenberg ( 1966 )  . 
2.1 The input
UNIVAUTO accepts as input the following , manually prepared , information : (1) A database (= a table ) , usually comprising a sizable number of languages , described in terms of some properties ( feature-value pairs )  , as well as a list of the abbreviations used in the database  . Below is a ( simplified ) description of the language Berber in terms of just  4 features : v-order ( = the position of verb , subject and object ) , na/an (= the position of noun and adjective ) , cn/pn ( = the position of common noun and proper noun )  , and pref/suf ( = the presence of prefix or suffix ) : data ( berber , [ v-order=vso , na/an=na , cnpn/pncn=* , pref/suf=both ]) . 
The value "*" is special , and is used to designate that either the feature cn pn/pncn is inapplicable for Berber or that the value for that feature is unknown  . 
(2 ) a human agent's discoveries ( represented as simple logical propositions , if originally formulated as complex ones ); e . g . : discovery ( agent = greenberg , no=3 , nonstatistical , implication ( v-order=vso , pr/po=pr)) . 
This record states that a human agent,
Greenberg , has found the implicational universal , relating two variables , to the effect that for all languages , if a language has a Verb-Subject-Object order then this language has prepositions  ( rather than postpositions )  , that this universals is nonstatistical ( holds without exceptions in the studied database )  , and that it is stated as Universal No . 3 in the original publication of the human agent . 
Aside from these basic sources of information , the input includes information on : the origin of database  , if any ( the full citation of work where the database is given  )  ; reference name(s ) of database , if any ; the kinds of objects rows and columns represent ; etc . .
2.2 The task
The task UNIVAUTO addresses can be formulated as follows : Given the input information  ( as described in 2 . 1) , find the language universals valid in the data , compare them with those discovered by some human agent  , and write a report , if appropriate . 
E . g . a query to the system may look like : ?- discover ( implication ( A , B) , non_statistical , positive_examples = 4 , compare_with=greenberg) . 
It amounts to requesting that nonstatistical implicational universals holding between two variables and supported in at least  4 positive examples be found , the results be compared with the findings of Greenberg  , and , if judged as interesting enough , a report of these discoveries be written . Other queries may also be formulated ( cf .  3 . 1) , but currently only such involving one type of universal and one database at a time  . 
2.3 The output
Below we list some excerpts from Pericliev ( 1999 ) as an illustration of the system output . 
The program was run on the data from
Greenberg (1966) , with the query in the preceding section . It discovered some problems in his analyses ( which forms the bulk of the text below ) as well as 59 novel universals of type " If Athen B , nonstatistical " ( as against 12 found by Greenberg , one of which further turned out to be wrong !) . The paragraphs have boldface numeration to be used for later reference  . 
Figure 1 . Illustrative output of UNIVAUTO  _______________________________________   [1] Further implicational universals in
Greenberg's data [2] The goal of this article is to study the implicational universals in the  30 languages sample of Greenberg 1966 and compare the results of the two studies . * <?>  [3] We confirmed the validity of universals [12  , 13 , 15-a , 15-b , 21-a , 22-a , 27-a] . 
[4] Universal [27-b ] is also true , however it violates our restriction pertaining to the occurrence of at least  4 positive examples in the dataset . [27-b ] is supported in 1 language ( Thai) . 
[5] Universals [16-a , 16-b , 16-c ] are uncertain , rather than ind is putably valid in the database investigated  , since they assume properties in languages , which are actually marked in the database as " unknown or inapplicable "  ( notated with "*" in Table 1 )  . Universal [16-a ] would hold only if the feature AuxV/VAux is applicable for Berber  , Hebrew , and Maori and in these languages the inflected auxiliary precedes the verb  . Universal [16-b ] would hold only if the feature AuxV/VAux is applicable for Burmese and Japanese and in these languages the verb precedes the inflected auxiliary  . 
Universal [16-c ] would hold only if the feature AuxV/VAux is applicable for Loritja and in this language the verb precedes the inflected auxiliary  . 
[6] Universal [23-a ] is false . It is falsified in Basque , Burmese , Burushaski , Finnish , Japanese , Norwegian , Nubian , and Turkish , in which the proper noun precedes the common noun but in which the noun does not precede the genitive  . 
[ 7] We found the following previously undiscovered universals in the data  . 
[8] Universal 1 . If in a language the adjective precedes the adverb then the main verb precedes the subordinate verb  . 
[ 9] Examples of this universal are 8 languages : Fulani , Guarani , Hebrew , Malay , Swahili , Thai , 
Yoruba , and Zapotec . <?> [10] Universal 59 . If a language has an initial yesno question particle then this language has the question word or phrase placed first in an interrogative word question  . ** <?>* The generated text continues with description of what an implicational universal is  , a table of Greenberg's 30 language sample , accompanied by the abbreviations used , and a listing of the universal she found . Hisuniversals , verbalized by our program , are listed with their numeration in the original publication  . An alphanumeric numeration means that an originally complex universal has been split into elementary ones of the form " If A then B "  . 
** There follows a conclusion which is a summary of the results  . 
_______________________________________  3 The UNIVAUTO System UNIVAUTO comprises two basic modules : one in charge of the discoveries of the program  , called UNIV ( ersals ) , and the other in charge of the verbalization of these discoveries  , called

3.1 The discovery module UNIV
UNIV discovers logical patterns (= universals ) , including ( but not limited to ): ? A ( absolute , non-implicational universal ) ? If A1 and A2 and A3 and . . . An , then B ( implicational universal )
UNIV can compute " nonstatistical " universals ( holding without exceptions ) or " statistical " universals ( holding with some user-specified percentage of exceptions  )  . 
Also , UNIV can compute ( implicational ) universals valid in ( at least ) a user-specified number of positive examples ( = languages )  , as well as compute the statistical significance of universals  ( based on the ?2 statistic )  . A minimal set-cover subroutine may guarantee the discovery of the smallest set  ( s ) of universals , generating a typology ( Pericliev 2002) . 
Importantly , given the discoveries of another , human agent , UNIV employs a diagnostic program to find ( eventual ) errors in the humanly proposed universals . Currently , we identify as PROBLEMS the following categories :   ( 1 ) Restriction Problem : Universals found by human analyst that are " under-supported "  , i . e . are below a user-selected threshold of positive evidence and/or percentage of validity  ( the latter applying to statistical universals )  . 
(2 ) Uncertainty Problem : Universals found by human analyst that tacitly assume a value for some linguistic property which is actually unknown or inapplicable  ( marked by '*' in the database )  . 
(3 ) Falsity Problem : Universals found by human analyst that are false or are logically implied by simpler universals  . 
The DISCOVERIES of UNIV are two lists , falling into one of the types : ( 1 ) new universals ( absolute or implicational , and statistical or nonstatistical ) , and (2) problems ( subcategorized as above ) . 
3.2 The authoring module AUTO
AUTO accepts as input the discoveries made by UNIV  , but also has access to the input data ( cf . 
2.1) to make further computations , as necessary.
AUTO can generally be characterized as a practical text generation system  , of opportunistic type , intended to meet the needs of our particular task  , rather than as a system intended to handle , in a general and principled way , scientific articles ' composition or surface generation of a wide range of linguistic phenomena  ( reminiscent of earlier work on generation from formatted data of metereological bulletins  ( Kittredge et . al . 's RAREAS ) or stock market reports ( Kukich's Ana ) ) . For applied NLG , cf . e . g . Reiter et . al . 
(1995); also Computational Linguistics 19984 (23) , and elsewhere . Xuang & Fielder ( 1996 ) and later work verbalize machine-found mathematical proofs  . 
First , AUTO needs to know whether the discoveries of UNIV are interesting enough for generating a report  , and to this end , it uses a natural and simple numeric method : UNIV's discoveries  ( new universals + problems ) are judged worthy of generating a report if they are at least as many in number as the number of the published discoveries of the human agent studying the same database  . 
Having decided upon report generation,
AUTO follows a fixed scenario for DISCOURSE COMPOSITION  ( scientific papers are known to follow such fixed structure in " genre analysis "  )  . 
The details of this scenario , however , will vary in accordance with a number of parameters  , related with the query to the system , the discoveries made in response to this query , as well as other considerations . The basic components of the scenario ( along side with some minor elaboration ) are given below . Each component is structured as a separate text paragraph  ( possibly with sub- ( sub ) -paragraphs )   . 
1 . Statement of title . Title is selected from one of the following foci :   ( i ) new_universals , ( ii ) problems , ( iii ) new_universals + problems . 
( Focus(i ) selected in Fig .  1, [1]  . ) 2 . Introduction of goal . Choice among same foci . ( Focus ( iii ) selected in Fig .  1, [2]  . ) 3 . Elaboration of goal . Logical definition of type of universal investigated  , constructed by our system , plus message on user-specified constraints ( supporting evidence , etc . ) . 
4 . Description of the investigated data and the human discoveries  . Based on data available from input . 
5 . Explaining the problems in the human discoveries . UNIV?s diagnostic subroutine feeds to AUTO problems classed in one of three subcategories  ( cf .  3 . 1) for AUTO to decide how to explain them . 
6 . Statement of machine discoveries . Input from the discoveries of UNIV . 
7 . Conclusion . Summary of findings ( new_universals and/or problems )  . 
8 . References . Based on data a vialable from input . 
Below we briefly outline component (5).
This paragraph comprises 4 sub-paragraphs , in this order : one conveying information on the confirmed humanly found universals  ( Fig .  1 ,  [3]) , and the remaining on problems of restrictions ( = under-support )  , uncertainty and falsity ( Fig .  1, [4,5,6]) . Each sub-paragraph starts with an intro_part , making a statement about a collection of discoveries  ( e . g . " Universals [1, 2, . .] are under-supported/uncertain/false . .") . 
All but the first sub-paragraph ( referring to confirmed discoveries ) also have a body_part , justifying why these predications hold for each individual discovery in the collection  . 
The body_parts appeal either solely to examples ( as in Fig .  1 ,  [4] , where mentioning an example of less support , appearing immediately after mentioning of the required one  , suffices for an explanation ) or to both examples and explanation of why these are indeed examples  . 
The latter situation is illustrated by ( Fig .  1, [5,6]) . Thus , for instance , the examples justifying that a universal is false are actually its counterexamples and AUTO will find these counterexamples as well as the reason for that  ( in the case of implication , antecedent true , but consequent false ) . 
AUTO also has a limited SENTENCE-
PLANNING FACILITY to decide how to split up a paragraph?s content into sentences and clauses  . 
Assume , for the sake of illustration , that we need to verbalize an under-support body_part  , like that on ( Fig . 1, par .  [4]) , but , say , requiring at least 8 supporting languages . The input to the sentence planning facility of AUTO would look like this  ( the last constituents indicating the number of supporting languages  ) : [3] -- is_supported--Berber , Hebrew , Maori , Masai , 
Welsh , Zapotec--6[12] -- is_supported--Berber , Hebrew , Maori , Masai , 
Welsh , Zapotec--6[15-a]--is_supported--Berber , Hebrew , Maori , Masai , 
Welsh , Z apotec--6   [27-b]--is_supported--Thai--1   [13]--is_supported--Burmese  , Burushaski , Hindi , 

AUTO will form separate sentences from the propositions having an equal number of supporting evidence  . Within the framework of each such sentence , the system will group together the propositions supported by the same languages  , taking care that the universals with smaller numeration appear first  . After some further transformations , the system outputs this: [27-b ] is supported in 1 language ( Thai )  . [13] is supported in 6 languages ( Burmese , Burushaski , Hindi , Japanese , Kannada , and Turkish ) , and so are [3 , 12 , 15-a ] ( Berber , Hebrew , Maori , Masai , Welsh , and Zapotec ) . 
For SURFACEGENERATION we use a hybrid approach , employing both templates and grammar rules , as required by the needs at the specific portions of text we are producing  . 
The templates consist of canned text , interspersed with variables whose values are to be computed  . The variables may stand either for individual words or for more abstract entities than words whose values are computed by grammar rules  . To ensure agreement e . g . AUTO employs rules for agreement between subject and predicate  , noun and determiner , demonstrative , relative-marker , apposition ; between noun and pronoun ( for pronominal reference )  ; externals and hi , etc . If e . g . a variable stands for a list of languages , it will be handled by a grammar rule for and -coordinated NP to get e  . g . " Masai , Welsh , and Zapotec " . Also , the templates are often randomly chosen among a set of " synonymous " alternatives in order to increase the variability of the produced texts  . 
We have grammar rules to handle a variety of syntactic constructions  , but the most important of them are those responsible for the verbalization of universals  ( forming by far the largest bulk of the produced texts  )  . The dictionary part of that grammar is supplied from input  ( cf .  2 . 1) . There are diverse ways of expressing implications in English  ( and we do not confine only to implications )  , and the grammar tries to attend to this fact . The grammar is a random generator , ensuring the avoidance of intra-textual repetitions in the statement of the many universals UNIV usually finds  . 
Finally , AUTO also supports formatting facilities , e . g . for capitalization , correct spacing around punctuation marks , etc . 
4 Conclusion
We have shown how a simple text generator can be linked to a linguistic discovery program in order to verbalize its discoveries  . Despite the seemingly bizarre nature of the task of article generation  , this work was actually inspired by the practical need to verbalize the great number of universals UNIV has systematically found in the various databases we have explored  , as well as by the need to compare these with the findings of previous researchers  . Presumably , such problems have not confronted previous discovery programs because they searched non -conventional spaces  ( necessitating additional human interpretation of results  )  , because their solution objects ( e . g . numerical laws in physics/mathematics , reaction path ways in chemistry , etc . ) are not amenable to verbal expression or simply because the set of solution objects has been too small to require automated verbalization  . 
In sum : UNIVAUTO models scientific domains in which a machine is likely to find numerous and verbalizable solution objects  ( conceivably , low-level generalisations ) , and the scientific discourses in these domains are basically limited to description of these findings  . 
We believe that such domains are not exceptional in empirical sciences generally  , and hence systems like ours are not unlikely to emerge to aid scientists in these domains  .
