"Is Speech Language ?".
Organisers : Joseph Mariani ( LIMSI , Paris ) , Steven Krauwer ( OTS , Utrecht )
Most people would no the sitate to give an affir-
mative answer to the question whether speech is
language . It seems so obviously true . Yet , when looking at what is happening in the language and speech research community one may feel tempted to believe that the two topics are totally unrelated : language and speech researchers have their own conferences  , their own journals , and their own professionals sociations . They have their own research projects , their own technological goals , and attending their conferences and reading their journals reveals a large number of differences in culture  , style and approach . 
These observations give raise to a number of questions  , such as :- Are the observations correct , or is it just a matter of misperception , caused by focussing on the differences rather than the similarities  . -What causes the differences : is it the fact that language and speech problems ARE different  , is it a matter of background and education , or is it a combination of both . - Is the separation of the two communities as justified as e  . g . 
the separation between astrology and astronomy , or should it be seen as a problem we should try to solve  . -Would NLP and Speech benefit from collaboration  ( new and better insights , theories , products ) , or would they just be in each other's way ? This panel  , organised by ELSNET ( The European Network in Language and Speech ) will address ( amongst others ) the questions formulated above . A number of prominent workers in the fields of NLP and Speech have been invited to present and confron their views  , and it is hoped that the audience will actively participate in the discussion  .
