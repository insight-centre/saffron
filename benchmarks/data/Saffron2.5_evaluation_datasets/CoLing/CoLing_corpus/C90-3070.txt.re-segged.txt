We meprototyping a system tor the self-learning of Chinese characters  , presently on a Macin tosh computer . 
The interactive inlormation base provides the learner with basic universal properties of the characters  ( morphology , intrinsic meaning ) , extended wilh a quite comprehensive set of language-dependent aspects  ( phonetics , extended semantics , contextual or pragmatic attributes ) . The user is intended to have a professional or cultural non-academic motivation  . The system allows to experiment on Heisig's proposal involving the separation of Chinese characters learning  ( or Japanese kanji ) from that of the language . A prototype under HyperC ~ rd may be demonstrated on a subset of about  200 characters . 

Chinese characters , Kanji , interactive information base , computer aided learning , personalized autonomous acquisition of Chinese characters  . 
1. Project motivation
The aim of the project is twofold : the first part is to model an : interactive information base on characteristic properties of Chinese characters  ( or Japanese kanji )  , which would lend itself to personalized self -instruction in a tree exploration or encyclopedic mode  ; and the second is to build the base on which we may subsequently explore an Intelligent Tutoring System architecture  , which would take into account the expertise already gained by the learner over prior sessions  . The work presented in the paper concerns the first aim  . 
The system is intended to provide a public of educated users with an adaptivenvironment for the autonomous learning and review of the properties of ideogrmns  , such as their etymology , structure , graphic form , phonetics , semantics , composition ( semantic and phonetic ) within other characters . . . \[CIYUAN 1984,
NELSONA . N . 1974\].
Our system is not for the study of the Chinese language or even of Chinese words  ( which are usually composed of more than one character  )  , but solely for that of the characters as basic morphological units  , even though instantiated with phonetic and semantic values in Chinese  . We had initially intended to follow Heisig's view \[ HEISIG  1977\]  , which separates the acquisition of the universal qualities of characters  ( basically morphology and intrinsic meaning )  , from the learning of language-dependent aspects ( such as the pronunciation , semantics , pragmatics in their use , etc ) . 
But for developing other applications , it seemed advisable to also include in our base a comprehensive knowledge of language  . -specific attributes , as it is first on Chinese language . 
The normal target user is not a scholar . He ( or she ) is an active adult , who is not assumed to have the available time nor the tb cusext motivation to undertake an intensive academic program  ( he is a scient is to rate chnical or industrial executive  )  . Rather , he wishes to study the characters in a self -paced  , extra curricular fashion , or to develop a multifaceted view of them according to his interests  . The user wants to grasp and to memorize characters ' important properties  , to initiate hisown " learning information base " on them  , so , for example , not to feel illiterate during working visits in China or Japan  . Later he might gradually enlarge and interrelate his personal knowledge items  . 
The learner will be given access , via an encyclopedic mode which provides a highly interactive user interface  , to either basic properties or to extra specific information on the characters  . He will be able to do so starting either from a key property he knows about a character  , or from a partial ( and even partially erroneous ) description of it . 
He will be also encouraged to record his personal discoveries or conclusions as additional materials : his personal mnemonics  , his own mental images or self-built references on semantic links between characters  , between their graphic form and meaning , etc . It has been shown that such an active and creative approach is very suitable to Western learners for autonomous acquisition and development of cognitive skills during file study of Japanese kanji \[ HEISIG  1977\]  . 
2. Overall view of the system
Central objects in the information base of the present project are : the current standard information base on characters  ( which merges basic and special material on their properties  , textual , ideographic , and sound data ) , the learner's current personal information base ( with his addition ~ flnotes )  , and the learner's current profile ( data heal ready accessed , drawn from a session journal or a global curriculum report  )  . 

The main functional handlers in the system are as follows : a learner and a developer interface  , a query analyzer and character selector , a session monitor , a session observer , and a session and profile editor . 
The identification and the selection of the working character  ( not a pattern recognition of a character drawn by hand  ) will interpret the learner's query , with respect to a subset of classical descriptive propertie such as : the meanings  , pinyin codes or stroke numbers of the character and/or of its semantic or phonetic radical if it has one  . An expert assistant module will be added to enhance the interactive character selection  , while managing missing or erroneous items in the query  . 
3. The information thesaurus of
Chinese characters
Activities proposed in the system allow the study of a comprehensivest of properties of a character  . In the information base there are actually two levels of accessibility : basic essential information  , and additional more detailed ( or erudite ) material \[ WIEGER 1972 , RYJIK 1980\] . They are all listed here , in the context of the Chinese language . 
Morphology : the etymology of the character , its iconographic origin and evolution , its generic a tegory ( among 6 classical ones ) , the calligraphy ( the stroke order , the different writing styles , their evolution )\[ ZHONGGUO
SHUFADAZIDIAN 1983\] , the structure ( synthetic representation f the morphological tree of the character  , semantic and/or phonetic radicals within it ) , the use in derivation or composition within other characters  . 
Phonetics : - the pinyin encoding , the tone , -the standard pronunciation ( from a digitized sound base )  , -ultimately , different provincial or colloquial pronunciations . 
Semantics : - the usual meaning , mnemonics proposed to the learner , learner's personal mnemonics ~ common " false friends "  ( misleading similarities )  , other characters in homomorphy , homonymy , usually confusing homophones , synonyms , antonyms . 
4. Current prototyping
We first modelled the pertinent material on characters  , and specified an interaction scheme for the user , then the learner interface . 
We refer to an iterative cycle for the software development  . We have prototyped first a simplified version of the system on a very small subset of the character base  , in order to validate the data structure , the design of the main functionals and the user interface  . 
We have chosen object-oriented programming tools as well-suited to the incremental realization scheme  . 
Thus far , this first version is being developed on Apple Macintosh under the Hyper Talk-Hyper Card environments  , regarded as fair facilities for implementing hypertextual and voiced applications  . A second level of prototyping is expected on a Xerox AI workstation using LOOPS and Common Lisp  . 
5. Further development
Short-term steps :
We are currently initiating the first model validation  . 
Then are planned both a moderate quantitative , and a qualitative , extension of the system . We will first enlarge the character set to about 300 units , while monitoring both systematic assembly cost , and system efficiency measurements . 
Qualitatively , the complementary properties in the character base will be completed  , and the phonetics will be voiced . Next to be worked on , in the prototype , are a session journal manager , and the interactive character identification and selection function  . 
In the future :
A possible trend leads towards a system of formative use  , with a real scale character base and ergonomic enrichment  . 
On another line for evolution , the system is a basis towards exploring knowledge based architectures  , which then incorporate objects and functional handlers inherited from the design of Intelligent Information Retrieval Systems \[ BRUAN DET  1989  , CHIARA MELLA 1987\] or Intelligent Tutoring Systems \[ WINKELS 1988  , 
WENGER 1988\].

Conc Iusion
The project focuses on characters only , yet a vast field of investigation for foreigners ( and one of practice and review , for native users ) . Moreover , extending the system capability to word formation  , then to structural or pragmatic views on the language itself  , would undoubtedly require much dedicated work on the language didactics  . 
It would be of interest however , in order to confirm or to infirm Heisig's hypothesis  , to experience different practice strategies on an adequate version of tim system  , and to value whether one better teams characters while setm rating their study from that of the language  , or while merging them . 
A rewarding aspect lies in the scopes of future system developments : a realistic and versatile pedagogic use on widely accessible micro -stations  , as well as a contribution to stepwise modelling of builtin intelligence  , for Computer Based Learnig Systems ; and last , in the attemp to develop tools forgiving larger access to Chinese characters - a vehicle for communication between over one billion people- in the frame of intercultural development  . 

My deep thanks will go indeed to Frango is Tcheou.
Without his wide expertise on tim Chinese language  , and distinguished calligraphy , this work could certainly not have been carried out  . Many thanks as well to Mohan Embar for patient reading of the first draft  .
