Abstract

Focusing on multidocument personal name disambiguation , this paper develops an agglomerative clustering approach to resolving this problem . We start from an analysis of pointwise mutual information between feature and the ambiguous name , which brings about a novel weight computing method for feature in clustering . Then a tradeoff measure between withincluster compactness and among-cluster separation is proposed for stopping clustering.
After that , we apply a labeling method to find representative feature for each cluster . Finally , experiments are conducted on word-based clustering in Chinese dataset and the result shows a good effect.
1 Introduction
Multidocument named entity coreference resolution is the process of determining whether an identical name occurring in different texts refers to the same entity in the real world . With the rapid development of multidocument applications like multidocument summarization and information fusion , there is an increasing need for multidocument named entity coreference resolution.
This paper focuses on multidocument personal name disambiguation , which seeks to determine if the same name from different documents refers to the same person.
This paper develops an agglomerative clustering approach to resolving multidocument personal name disambiguation . In order to represent texts better , a novel weight computing method for clustering features is presented . It is based on the pointwise mutual information between the ambiguous name and features . This paper also develops a tradeoff point based cluster-stopping measure and a labeling algorithm for each clusters . Finally , experiments are conducted on word-based clustering in Chinese dataset . The dataset contains eleven different personal names with varying-sized datasets , and has 1669 texts in all.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows : in Section 2 we review the related work ; Section 3 describes the framework ; section 4 introduces our methodologies including feature weight computing with pointwise mutual information , cluster-stopping measure based on tradeoff point , and cluster labeling algorithm . These are the main contribution of this paper ; Section 5 discusses our experimental result . Finally , the conclusion and suggestions for further extension of the work are given in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Due to the varying ambiguity of personal names in a corpus , existing approaches typically cast it as an unsupervised clustering problem based on vector space model . The main difference among these approaches lies in the features , which are used to create a similarity space . Bagga & Baldwin (1998) first performed within-document coreference resolution , and then explored features in local context . Mann & Yarowsky (2003) extracted local biographical information as features.
Al-Kamha and Embley (2004) clustered search results with feature set including attributes , links and page similarities . Chen and Martin (2007) explored the use of a range of syntactic and semantic features in unsupervised clustering of documents . Song (2007) learned the PLSA and LDA model as feature sets . Ono et al (2008) used mixture features including cooccurrences ic information . Previous works usually focus on feature identification and feature selection . The method to assign appropriate weight to each feature has not been discussed widely.
A major challenge in clustering analysis is determining the number of ? clusters ?. Therefore , clustering based approaches to this problem still require estimating the number of clusters . In Hierarchy clustering , it equates to determine the stopping step of clustering . The measure to find the ? knee ? in the criterion function curve is a well known cluster-stopping measure . Pedersen and Kulkarni had studied this problem ( Pedersen and Kulkarni , 2006). They developed cluster-stopping measures named PK1, PK2, PK3, and presented the Adapted Gap Statistics.
After estimating the number of ? clusters ?, we obtain the clustering result . In order to label the ? clusters ?, the method that finding representative features for each ? cluster ? is needed . For example , the captain John Smith can be labeled as captain.
Pedersen and Kulkarni (2006) selected the top N non-stopping word features from texts grouped in a cluster as label.
3 Framework
On the assumption of ? one person per document ? ( i.e . all mentions of an ambiguous personal name in one document refer to the same personal entity ), the task of disambiguating personal name in text set intends to partition the set into subsets , where each subset refer to one particular entity.
Suppose the set of texts containing the ambiguous name is denoted by D = { d1,d2,?,dn }, and di (0<i<n+1) stands for one text . The entities with the ambiguous name are denoted by a set E = { e1,e2,?,em }, where the number of entities ? m ? is unknown . The ambiguous name in each text di indicates only one entity ek . The aim of the work is to map an ambiguous name appearing in each text to an entity . Therefore , those texts indicating the same entity need to be clustered together.
In determining whether a personal name refers to a specific entity , the personal information , social network information and related topics play important roles , all of which are expressed by words in texts ,. Extracting words as features , this paper applies an agglomerative clustering approach to resolving name coreference . The framework of our approach consists of the following seven main steps : Step 1: Preprocess each text with Chinese word segmentation tool ; Step 2: Extract words as features from the set of texts D;.
Step 3: Represent texts d1,?,dn by features vectors ; Step 4: Calculate similarity between texts ; Step 5: Cluster the set D step by step until only one cluster exists ; Step 6: Estimate the number of entities in accordance with cluster-stopping measure ; Step 7: Assign each cluster a discriminating label.

This paper focuses on the Step 4, Step 6 and Step 7, i.e ., feature weight computing method , clustering stopping measure and cluster labeling method . They will be described in the next section in detail.
Step1 and Step3 are simple , and there is no further description here . In Step 2, we use cooccurrence words of the ambiguous name in texts as features . In the process of agglomerative clustering ( see Step 5), each text is viewed as one cluster at first , and the most similar two clusters are merged together as a new cluster at each round . After replacing the former two clusters with the new one , we use average linked method to update similarity between clusters.
4 Methodology 4.1 Feature weight
Each text is represented as a feature vector , and each item of the vector represents the weight value for corresponding feature in the text . Since our approach is completely unsupervised we cannot use supervised methods to select significant features . Since the weight of feature will be adjusted well instead of feature selection , all words in set D are used as feature in our approach.
The problem of computing feature weight is involved in both text clustering and text classification . By comparing the supervised text classification and unsupervised text clustering , we find that the former one has a better performance owing to the selection of features and the computing method of feature weight . Firstly , in the application of supervised text classification , features can be selected by many methods , such as , Mutual Information ( MI ) and Expected Cross Entropy ( ECE ) feature selection methods . Secondly , model training methods , such as SVM model , are generally adopted by programs when to find the for unsupervised tasks , so abovementioned methods are unsuitable for text clustering.
In addition , we find that the text clustering for personal name disambiguation is different from common text clustering . System can easily judge whether a text contains the ambiguous personal name or not . Thus the whole collection of texts can be easily divided into two classes : texts with or without the name . As a result , we can easily calculate the pointwise mutual information between feature words and the personal name.
To a certain extent , it represents the correlative degree between feature words and the underlying entity corresponding to the personal name.
For these reasons , our feature weight computing method calculates the pointwise mutual information between personal name and feature word . And the value of pointwise mutual information will be used to expresse feature word?s weight by combining the feature?s tf ( the abbreviation for term-frequency ) in text and idf ( the abbreviation for inverse document frequency ) in dataset . The formula of feature weight computing proposed in this paper is as below , and it is need both texts containing and not containing the ambiguous personal name to form dataset D . For each tk in di that contains name , its mi_weight is computed as follow : ))(|| log()),MI(1log ( ))),( log(1(),,_weight(mi kk ikik tdfDnamet dttfdnamet ?+? += (1)
And )()( ||),( ||/)()( ||/),( )()( ),( ), MI ( k k k k k k tdfnamedf
Dtnamedf
Dtdfnamedf
Dtnamedf tpnamep tnamep namet ? ?= ?= ?= (2) Where tk is a feature ; name is the ambiguous name ; di is the ith text in dataset ; tf(tk,di ) represents term frequency of feature tk in text di ; df(tk ), df(name ) is the number of the texts containing tk or name in dataset D respectively ; df(tk,name ) is the number of texts containing both tk and name ; | D | is the number of all the texts.
Formula (2) can be comprehended as : if word tk occurs much more times in texts containing the ambiguous name than in texts not containing the name , it must have some information about the name.
A widely used approach for computing feature weight is tf*idf scheme as formula (3) ( Salton and Buckley . 1998), which only uses the texts containing the ambiguous name . We denote it by old_weight . For each tk in di containing name , the old_weight is computed as follow : )),()( log ( ))),( log(1( ),,( old_weight nametdfnamedf dttf dnamet k ik ik ? += (3) The first term on the right side is tf , and the second term is idf . If the idf scheme is computed in the whole dataset D for reducing noise , the weight computing formula can be expressed as follow , and is denoted by imp_weight : ))(| D|log())),(log(1( ),_weight(imp kik ik tdfdttf dt ?+= (4) Before clustering , the similarity between texts is computed by cosine value of the angle between vectors ( such as dx , dy in formula (5)): yx yx yx dd dd d,d ? ?=) cos ( (5) Each item of the vector ( i.e . dx , dy ) represents the weight value for corresponding feature in the text.
4.2 Cluster-stopping measure
The process of clustering will produce n cluster results , one for each step . Independent of clustering algorithm , the cluster stopping measure should choose the cluster results which can represent the structure of data.
A fundamental and difficult problem in cluster analysis is to measure the structure of clustering result . The geometric structure is a representative method . It defines that a ? good ? clustering results should make data points from one cluster ? compact ?, while data points from different cluster are ? separate ? as far as possible . The indicators should quantify the ? compactness ? and ? separation ? for clusters , and combine both . In the study of cluster stopping measures by Pedersen and Kulkarni (2006), the criterion functions defines text similarity based on cosine value of the angle between vectors . Their cluster-stopping measures focused on finding the ? knee ? of criterion function.
Our cluster-stopping measure is also based on the geometric structure of dataset . The measure aims to find the tradeoff point between withincluster compactness and among-cluster separation . Both the withincluster compactness ( Internal critical function ) and among-cluster by Euclidean distance . The hybrid critical function ( Hybrid critical function ) combines internal and external criterion functions.
Suppose that the given dataset contains N references , which are denoted as : d1,d2,?,dN ; the data have been repeatedly clustered into k clusters , where k=N,?,1; and clusters are denoted as Cr , r=1,?k ; and the number of references in each cluster is nr , so nr=|Cr |. We introduce Incrf ( Internal critical function ), Excrf ( External critical function ) and Hycrf ( Hybrid critical function ) to measure it as follows.
?? = ? ?= k i k iyx Cd,d ? ? ? = ?= ?? ?= k i k ijj jinn k 1 ,1 jyix Cd,Cd (7) )) Excrf()(Incrf(
M
Where M=Incrf(1)=Excrf(N)
Figure 1 Hycrf vs . t ( Nk)
Chen proved the existence of the minimum value between (0,1) in Hycrf(k ) ( see Chen et al 2008). The Hycrf value in a typical Hycrf(t ) curve is shown as Figure 1, where t=N-k.
Function Hycrf based on Incrf and Excrf is used as the Hybrid criterion function . The Hycrf curve will rise sharply after the minimum , indicating that the cluster of several optimal partitions ? subsets will lead to drastic drop in cluster quality . Thus cluster partition can be determined.
Using the attributes of the Hycrf(k ) curve , we put forward a new cluster-stopping measure named tradeoff point based cluster-stopping measure ( TO_CSM).
)1Hycrf ( ) Hycrf ( )1Hycrf ( k k k (9)
Tradeoff point based cluster-stopping measure ( TO_CSM ) selects the k value which maximizes TO_CSM(k ), and indicates the number of cluster . The first term on the right side of formula (9) is used to minimize the value of Hycrf(k ), and the second one is used to find the ? knee ? rising sharply.
4.3 Labeling
Once the clusters are created , we label each entity to represent the underlying entity with some important information . A label is represented as a list of feature words , which summarize the information about cluster?s underlying entity.
The algorithm is outlined as follows : after clustering N references into m clusters , for each cluster Ck in { C1, C2, ?, Cm }, we calculate the score of each feature for Ck and choose features as the label of Ck whose scores rank top N . In particular , the score caculated in this paper is different from Pedersen and Kulkarni?s (2006).
We combine pointwise mutual information computing method with term frequency in cluster to compute the score.
The formula of feature scoring for labeling is shown as follows : ))),( log(1( ),( MI),MI(),Score ( name ik ikkik
Cttf
CtnametCt +? ?= (10)
The calculation of MI(tk,name ) is shown as formula (2) in subsection 4.1. tf(tk,Ci ) represents the total occurrence frequency of feature tk in cluster Ci . The MIname(tk,Ci ) is computed as formula (11): )()( ||),( ||/)()( ||/),( )()( ),( ) C,(MI ik ik ik ik ik ikname
Cdftdf
DCtdf
DCdftdf
DCtdf
Cptp
Ctp t ? ?= ?= ?= (11)
In formula (10), the weight of stopping words can be reduced by the first item . The second item can increase the weight of words with high distinguishing ability for a certain ambiguous name.
The third item of formula (10) gives higher scores to features whose frequency are higher.

Table 1 Statistics of the test dataset
We first convert all the downloaded documents into plain text format to facilitate the test process , and preprocess them by using the segmentation toolkit ICTCLAS2.
In testing and evaluating , we adopt BCubed definition for Precision , Recall and FMeasure as indicators ( Bagga , Amit and Baldwin . 1998).
FMeasure is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
The definitions are presented as below : 1 April.2008 2 http://ictclas.org / ? ?= Dd dprecisionNprecision 1 (12) ? ?= Dd drecallNrecall 1 (13) recallprecision recallprecision measureF + ??=? 2 (14) where precisiond is the precision for a text d.
Suppose the text d is in subset A , precisiond is the percentage of texts in A which indicates the same entity as d . Recalld is the recall ratio for a text d . Recalld is the ratio of number of texts which indicates the same entity as d in A to that in corpus D . n = | D |, D refers to a collection of texts containing a particular name ( such as Wang Tao , e.g . a set of 200 texts , n = 200). Subset A is a set formed after clustering ( text included in class ), and d refers to a certain text that containing " Wang Tao".
5.2 Result
All the 1669 texts in the dataset are employed during experiment . Each personal name disambiguation process only clusters the texts containing the ambiguous name . After preprocessing , in order to verify the mi_weight method for feature weight computing , all the words in texts are used as features.
Using formula (1), (3) and (4) as feature weight computing formula , we can get the evaluation of cluster result shown as table 2. In this step , cluster-stopping measure is not used . Instead , the highest Fmeasure during clustering is highlighted to represent the efficiency of the feature weight computing method.
Further more , we carry out the experiment on the tradeoff point based cluster-stopping measure , and compare its cluster result with highest Fmeasure and cluster result determined by cluster-stopping measure PK3 proposed by
Pedersen and Kulkarni?s . Based on the experiment in Table 2, a structure tree is constructed in the clustering process . Cluster-stopping measures are used to determine where to stop cutting the dendrogram . As shown in Table 3, the TO-CMS method predicts the optimal results of four names in eleven , while PK3 method predicts the optimal result of one name , which are marked in a bold type.

Table 4 Labels for ? Lewis ? clusters
On the basis of text clustering result that obtained from the Tradeoff based cluster-stopping measure experiment in Table 3, we try our labelling method mentioned in subsection 4.3.
For each cluster , we choose 12 words with highest score as its label . The experiment result demonstrates that the created label is able to represent the category . Take name ???? Liu-Yi-si ? Lewis ?? for example , the labeling result shown as Table 4.
5.3 Discussion
From the test result in table 2, we find that our feature weight computing method can improve the Chinese personal name clustering disambiguation performance effectively . For each personal name in test dataset , the performance is improved obviously . The average value of optimal Fmeasures for eleven names rises from 85.04% to 91.28% by using the whole dataset D for calculated idf , and rises from 91.28% to 93.23% by using mi_weight . Therefore , in the application of Chinese text clustering with constraints , we can compute pointwise mutual information between constraints and feature , and it can be merged with feature weight value to improve the clustering performance.
We can see from table 3 that tradeoff point based cluster-stopping measure ( TO_CSM ) performs much better than PK3. According to the experimental results , PK3 measure is not that robust . The optimal number of clusters can be determined for certain data . However , we found that it did not apply to all cases . For example , it obtains the optimal estimation result for data ? Michelle ?, as for ? Liu Shuzhen ?, ? Wang Gang ? and ? Johnson ?, the results are extremely bad.
The better result is achieved by using TO_CSM measure , and the selected results are closer to the optimal value . The PK3 measure uses the mean and the standard deviation to deduce , and its processes are more complicated than TO_CSM?s.
Our cluster labeling method computes the features ? score with formula (10). From the labeling results sample shown in Table 4, we can see that all of the labels are representative . Most of them are person and organizations ? name , and the rest are key compound words . Therefore , when the clustering performance is good , the quality of cluster labels created by our method is also good.
6 Future Work
This paper developed a clustering algorithm of multidocument personal name disambiguation , and put forward a novel feature weight computing method for vector space model . This method computes weight with the pointwise mutual information between the personal name and feature.
We also study a hybrid criterion function based on tradeoff point and put forward the tradeoff point cluster-stopping measure . At last , we experiment on our score computing method for cluster labeling.
Unsupervised personal name disambiguation techniques can be extended to address the problem of unsupervised Entity Resolution and unsupervised word sense discrimination . We will attempt to apply the feature weight computing method to these fields.
One of the main directions of our future work will be how to improve the performance of personal name disambiguation . Computing weight based on a window around names may be helpful.
Moreover , word-based text features haven?t solved two difficult problems of natural language problems : Synonym and Polysemy , which seriously affect the precision and efficiency of clustering algorithms . Text representation based on concept and topic may solve the problem.
