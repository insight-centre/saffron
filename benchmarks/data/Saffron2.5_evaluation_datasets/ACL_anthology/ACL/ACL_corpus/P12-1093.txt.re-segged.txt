Abstract
This paper uses an unsupervised model of grounded language acquisition to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition . The input to the model consists of ( orthographically transcribed ) child-directed utterances accompanied by the set of objects present in the nonlinguistic context . Each object is annotated by social cues , indicating e.g ., whether the caregiver is looking at or touching the object . We show how to model the task of inferring which objects are being talked about ( and which words refer to which objects ) as standard grammatical inference , and describe PCFG-based unigram models and adaptor grammar-based collocation models for the task . Exploiting social cues improves the performance of all models . Our models learn the relative importance of each social cue jointly with word-object mappings and collocation structure , consistent with the idea that children could discover the importance of particular social information sources during word learning.
1 Introduction
From learning sounds to learning the meanings of words , social interactions are extremely important for children?s early language acquisition ( Baldwin , 1993; Kuhl et al , 2003). For example , children who engage in more joint attention ( e.g . looking at particular objects together ) with caregivers tend to learn words faster ( Carpenter et al , 1998). Yet computational or formal models of social interaction are rare , and those that exist have rarely gone beyond the stage of cue-weighting models . In order to study the role that social cues play in language acquisition , this paper presents a structured statistical model of grounded learning that learns a mapping between words and objects from a corpus of child-directed utterances in a completely unsupervised fashion . It exploits five different social cues , which indicate which object ( if any ) the child is looking at , which object the child is touching , etc . Our models learn the salience of each social cue in establishing reference , relative to their cooccurrence with objects that are not being referred to . Thus , this work is consistent with a view of language acquisition in which children learn to learn , discovering organizing principles for how language is organized and used socially ( Baldwin , 1993; Hollich et al , 2000; Smith et al ., 2002).
We reduce the grounded learning task to a grammatical inference problem ( Johnson et al , 2010; Bo?rschinger et al , 2011). The strings presented to our grammatical learner contain a prefix which encodes the objects and their social cues for each utterance , and the rules of the grammar encode relationships between these objects and specific words.
These rules permit every object to map to every word ( including function words ; i.e ., there is no ? stop word ? list ), and the learning process decides which of these rules will have a nontrivial probability ( these encode the object-word mappings the system has learned).
This reduction of grounded learning to grammatical inference allows us to use standard grammatical inference procedures to learn our models . Here we use the adaptor grammar package described in Johnson et al (2007) and Johnson and Goldwater (2009) with ? out of the box ? default settings ; no parameter tuning whatsoever was done . Adaptor grammars are a framework for specifying hierarchical nonparametric models that has been previously used to model language acquisition ( Johnson , 2008).

Social cue Value child.eyes objects child is looking at child.hands objects child is touching mom.eyes objects caregiver is looking at mom.hands objects caregiver is touching mom.point objects caregiver is pointing to Figure 1: The 5 social cues in the Frank et al ( to appear ) corpus . The value of a social cue for an utterance is a subset of the available topics ( i.e ., the objects in the nonlinguistic context ) of that utterance.
A semanticist might argue that our view of referential mapping is flawed : full noun phrases ( e.g ., the dog ), rather than nouns , refer to specific objects , and nouns denote properties ( e.g ., dog denotes the property of being a dog ). Learning that a noun , e.g ., dog , is part of a phrase used to refer to a specific dog ( say , Fido ) does not suffice to determine the noun?s meaning : the noun could denote a specific breed of dog , or animals in general . But learning word-object relationships is a plausible first step for any learner : it is often only the contrast between learned relationships and novel relationships that allows children to induce super - or subordinate mappings ( Clark , 1987).
Nevertheless , in deference to such objections , we call the object that a phrase containing a given noun refers to the topic of that noun . ( This is also appropriate , given that our models are specialisations of topic models).
Our models are intended as an ? ideal learner ? approach to early social language learning , attempting to weight the importance of social and structural factors in the acquisition of word-object correspondences . From this perspective , the primary goal is to investigate the relationships between acquisition tasks ( Johnson , 2008; Johnson et al , 2010), looking for synergies ( areas of acquisition where attempting two learning tasks jointly can provide gains in both ) as well as areas where information overlaps.
1.1 A training corpus for social cues
Our work here uses a corpus of child-directed speech annotated with social cues , described in Frank et al ( to appear ). The corpus consists of 4,763 orthographically-transcribed utterances of caregivers to their prelinguistic children ( ages 6, 12, and 18 months ) during home visits where children played with a consistent set of toys . The sessions were videotaped , and each utterance was annotated with the five social cues described in Figure 1.
Each utterance in the corpus contains the following information : ? the sequence of orthographic words uttered by the caregiver , ? a set of available topics ( i.e ., objects in the nonlinguistic objects ), ? the values of the social cues , and ? a set of intended topics , which the caregiver refers to.
Figure 2 presents this information for an example utterance . All of these but the intended topics are provided to our learning algorithms ; the intended topics are used to evaluate the output produced by our learners.
Generally the intended topics consist of zero or one elements from the available topics , but not always : it is possible for the caregiver to refer to two objects in a single utterance , or to refer to an object not in the current nonlinguistic context ( e.g ., to a toy that has been put away ). There is a considerable amount of anaphora in this corpus , which our models currently ignore.
Frank et al ( to appear ) give extensive details on the corpus , including interannotator reliability information for all annotations , and provide detailed statistical analyses of the relationships between the various social cues , the available topics and the intended topics . That paper also gives instructions on obtaining the corpus.
1.2 Previous work
There is a growing body of work on the role of social cues in language acquisition . The language acquisition research community has long recognized the importance of social cues for child language acquisition ( Baldwin , 1991; Carpenter et al , 1998; Kuhl et al , 2003).
Siskind (1996) describes one of the first examples of a model that learns the relationship between words and topics , albeit in a nonstatistical framework . Yu and Ballard (2007) describe an associative learner that associates words with topics and that exploits prosodic as well as social cues . The relative importance of the various social cues are specified a priori in their model ( rather than learned , as they are here ), and unfortunately their training corpus is not available . Frank et al (2008) describes a Bayesian model that learns the relationship between words and topics , but the version of their model that included social cues presented a number of challenges for inference . The unigram model we describe below corresponds most closely to the Frank Figure 2: The photograph indicates nonlinguistic context containing a ( toy ) pig and dog for the utterance Where?s the piggie ?. Below that , we show the representation of this utterance that serves as the input to our models . The prefix ( the portion of the string before the ?##?) lists the available topics ( i.e ., the objects in the nonlinguistic context ) and their associated social cues ( the cues for the pig are child.eyes , mom.eyes and mom.hands , while the dog is not associated with any social cues ). The intended topic is the pig . The learner?s goals are to identify the utterance?s intended topic , and which words in the utterance are associated with which topic.

2 Reducing grounded learning with social cues to grammatical inference This section explains how we reduce ground learning problems with social cues to grammatical inference problems , which lets us apply a wide variety of grammatical inference algorithms to grounded learning problems . An advantage of reducing grounded learning to grammatical inference is that it suggests new ways to generalise grounded learning models ; we explore three such generalisations here . The main challenge in this reduction is finding a way of expressing the nonlinguistic information as part of the strings that serve as the grammatical inference procedure?s input . Here we encode the nonlinguistic information in a ? prefix ? to each utterance as shown in Figure 2, and devise a grammar such that inference for the grammar corresponds to learning the word-topic relationships and the salience of the social cues for grounded learning.
All our models associate each utterance with zero or one topics ( this means we cannot correctly analyse utterances with more than one intended topic).
We analyse an utterance associated with zero topics as having the special topic None , so we can assume that every utterance has exactly one topic . All our grammars generate strings of the form shown in Figure 2, and they do so by parsing the prefix and the words of the utterance separately ; the toplevel rules of the grammar force the same topic to be associated with both the prefix and the words of the utterance ( see Figure 3).
2.1 Topic models and the unigram PCFG
As Johnson et al (2010) observe , this kind of grounded learning can be viewed as a specialised kind of topic inference in a topic model , where the utterance topic is constrained by the available objects ( possible topics ). We exploit this observation here using a reduction based on the reduction of LDA topic models to PCFGs proposed by Johnson (2010). This leads to our first model , the unigram grammar , which is a PCFG.1 1In fact , the unigram grammar is equivalent to a HMM , but the PCFG parameterisation makes clear the relationship

Figure 4 presents the rules of the unigram grammar . This grammar has two major parts . The rules expanding the Topict nonterminals ensure that the social cues for the available topic t are parsed under the Topical nonterminals . All other available topics are parsed under TNone nonterminals , so their social cues are parsed under NotTopical nonterminals . The rules expanding these nonterminals are specifically designed so that the generation of the social cues corresponds to a series of binary decisions about each social cue . For example , the probability of the rule Topicalchild.eyes ? . child.eyes Topicalchild.hands is the probability of an object that is an utterance topic occuring with the child.eyes social cue . By estimating the probabilities of these rules , the model effectively learns the probability of each social cue being associated with a Topical or a NotTopical available topic , respectively.
The nonterminals Wordst expand to a sequence of Wordt and WordNone nonterminals , each of which can expand to any word whatsoever . In practice Wordt will expand to those words most strongly associated with topic t , while WordNone will expand to those words not associated with any topic.

2.2 Adaptor grammars
Our other grounded learning models are based on reductions of grounded learning to adaptor grammar inference problems . Adaptor grammars are a framework for stating a variety of Bayesian nonparametric models defined in terms of a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor Processes : see Johnson et al (2007) for a formal description . Informally , an adaptor grammar is specified by a set of rules just as in a PCFG , plus a set of adapted nonterminals . The set of trees generated by an adaptor grammar is the same as the set of trees generated by a PCFG with the same rules , but the generative process differs . Non-adapted nonterminals in an adaptor grammar expand just as they do in a PCFG : the probability of choosing a rule is specified by its probability . However , the expansion of an adapted nonterminal depends on how it expanded in previous derivations . An adapted nonterminal can directly expand to a subtree with probability proportional to the number of times that subtree has been previously generated ; it can also ? back off ? to expand using a grammar rule , just as in a PCFG , with probability proportional to a con-stant.2 Thus an adaptor grammar can be viewed as caching each tree generated by each adapted nonterminal , and regenerating it with probability proportional to the number of times it was previously generated ( with some probability mass reserved to generate ? new ? trees ). This enables adaptor gram-2This is a description of Chinese Restaurant Processes , which are the predictive distributions for Dirichlet Processes.
Our adaptor grammars are actually based on the more general Pitman-Yor Processes , as described in Johnson and Goldwater (2009).

mars to generalise over subtrees of arbitrary size.
Generic software is available for adaptor grammar inference , based either on Variational Bayes ( Cohen et al , 2010) or Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( Johnson and Goldwater , 2009). We used the latter software because it is capable of performing hyperparameter inference for the PCFG rule probabilities and the Pitman-Yor Process parameters . We used the ? out-of-the-box ? settings for this software , i.e ., uniform priors on all PCFG rule parameters , a Beta(2, 1) prior on the Pitman-Yor a parameters and a ? vague ? Gamma(100, 0.01) prior on the Pitman-Yor b parameters . ( Presumably performance could be improved if the priors were tuned , but we did not explore this here).
Here we explore a simple ? collocation ? extension to the unigram PCFG which associates multiword collocations , rather than individual words , with topics . Hardisty et al (2010) showed that this significantly improved performance in a sentiment analysis task.
The collocation adaptor grammar in Figure 5 generates the words of the utterance as a sequence of collocations , each of which is a sequence of words.
Each collocation is either associated with the sentence topic or with the None topic , just like words in the unigram model . Figure 6 shows a sample parse generated by the collocation adaptor grammar.

Word ? w ? w ? W
In these variant grammars , the WordNone nonterminal generates all the words of the language , so it defines a generic ? background ? distribution over all the words , rather than just the nontopical words . An effect of this is that the variant grammars tend to identify fewer words as topical.
3 Experimental evaluation
We performed grammatical inference using the adaptor grammar software described in Johnson and Goldwater (2009).3 All experiments involved 4 runs of 5,000 samples each , of which the first 2,500 were discarded for ? burn-in?.4 From these samples we extracted the modal ( i.e ., most frequent ) analysis , 3Because adaptor grammars are a generalisation of PCFGs , we could use the adaptor grammar software to estimate the unigram model.
4We made no effort to optimise the computation , but it seems the samplers actually stabilised after around a hundred iterations , so it was probably not necessary to sample so extensively . We estimated the error in our results by running our most complex model ( the colloc ? model with all social cues ) 20 times ( i.e ., 20?8 chains for 5,000 iterations ) so we could compute the variance of each of the evaluation scores ( it is reasonable to assume that the simpler models will have smaller variance ). The standard deviation of all utterance topic and word topic measures is between 0.005 and 0.01; the standard deviation for lexicon fscore is 0.02, lexicon precision is 0.01 and lexicon recall is 0.03. The adaptor grammar software uses a sentence-wise which we evaluated as described below . The results of evaluating each model on the corpus with social cues , and on another corpus identical except that the social cues have been removed , are presented in Figure 7.
Each model was evaluated on each corpus as follows . First , we extracted the utterance?s topic from the modal parse ( this can be read off the Topict nodes ), and compared this to the intended topics annotated in the corpus . The frequency with which the models ? predicted topics exactly matches the intended topics is given under ? utterance topic accuracy ?; the fscore , precision and recall of each model?s topic predictions are also given in the table.
Because our models all associate word tokens with topics , we can also evaluate the accuracy with which word tokens are associated with topics . We constructed a small dictionary which identifies the words that can be used as the head of a phrase to refer to the topical objects ( e.g ., the dictionary indicates that dog , doggie and puppy name the topical object DOG ). Our dictionary is relatively conservative ; between one and eight words are associated with each topic . We scored the topic label on each word token in our corpus as follows . A topic label is scored as correct if it is given in our dictionary and the topic is one of the intended topics for the utterance . The ? word topic ? entries in Figure 7 give the results of this evaluation.
blocked sampler , so it requires fewer iterations than a pointwise sampler . We used 5,000 iterations because this is the soft-ware?s default setting ; evaluating the trace output suggests it only takes several hundred iterations to ? burn in ?. However , we ran 8 chains for 25,000 iterations of the colloc ? model ; as expected the results of this run are within two standard deviations of the results reported above.

The ? importance ? of a social cue can be quantified by the degree to which the model?s evaluation score improves when using a corpus containing that social cue relative to its evaluation score when using a corpus without any social cues.
The most important social cue is the one which causes performance to improve the most.
Finally , we extracted a lexicon from the parsed corpus produced by each model . We counted how often each word type was associated with each topic in our sampler?s output ( including the None topic ), and assigned the word to its most frequent topic.
The ? lexicon ? entries in Figure 7 show how well the entries in these lexicons match the entries in the manually-constructed dictionary discussed above.
There are 10 different evaluation scores , and no model dominates in all of them . However , the top-scoring result in every evaluation is always for a model trained using social cues , demonstrating the importance of these social cues . The variant collocation model ( trained on data with social cues ) was the top-scoring model on four evaluation scores , which is more than any other model.
One striking thing about this evaluation is that the recall scores are all much higher than the precision scores , for each evaluation . This indicates that all of the models , especially the unigram model , are labelling too many words as topical . This is perhaps not too surprising : because our models completely lack any notion of syntactic structure and simply model the association between words and topics , they label many nonnouns with topics ( e.g ., woof is typically labelled with the topic DOG).
3.1 Evaluating the importance of social cues It is scientifically interesting to be able to evaluate the importance of each of the social cues to grounded learning . One way to do this is to study the effect of adding or removing social cues from the corpus on the ability of our models to perform grounded learning . An important social cue should have a large impact on our models ? performance ; an unimportant cue should have little or no impact.
Figure 8 compares the performance of the unigram and collocation models on corpora containing a single social cue to their performance on the corpus without any social cues , while Figure 9 compares the performance of these models on corpora containing all but one social cue to the corpus containing all of the social cues . In both of these evaluations , with respect to all 10 evaluation measures , the child.eyes social cue had the most impact on model performance.
Why would the child?s own gaze be more important than the caregiver?s ? Perhaps caregivers are following in , i.e ., talking about objects that their children are interested in ( Baldwin , 1991). However , another possible explanation is that this result is due to the general continuity of conversational topics over time . Frank et al ( to appear ) show that for the current corpus , the topic of the preceding utterance is very likely to be the topic of the current one also.
Thus , the child?s eyes might be a good predictor because they reflect the fact that the child?s attention has been drawn to an object by previous utterances.
Notice that these two possible explanations of the importance of the child.eyes cue are diametrically opposed ; the first explanation claims that the cue is important because the child is driving the discourse , while the second explanation claims that the cue is important because the child?s gaze follows the topic of the caregiver?s previous utterance .

The ? importance ? of a social cue can be quantified by the degree to which the model?s evaluation score degrades when that just social cue is removed from the corpus , relative to its evaluation score when using a corpus without all social cues . The most important social cue is the one which causes performance to degrade the most.
enue for future investigation using more structured models such as those proposed here.5 4 Conclusion and future work This paper presented four different grounded learning models that exploit social cues . These models are all expressed via reductions to grammatical inference problems , so standard ? off the shelf ? grammatical inference tools can be used to learn them.
Here we used the same adaptor grammar software tools to learn all these models , so we can be relatively certain that any differences we observe are due to differences in the models , rather than quirks in the software.
Because the adaptor grammar software performs full Bayesian inference , including for model parameters , an unusual feature of our models is that we did not need to perform any parameter tuning whatsoever . This feature is particularly interesting with respect to the parameters on social cues . Psychological proposals have suggested that children may discover that particular social cues help in establishing reference ( Baldwin , 1993; Hollich et al , 2000), but prior modeling work has often assumed that cues , cue weights , or both are prespecified . In contrast , the models described here could in principle discover a wide range of different social conventions.
5A reviewer suggested that we can test whether child.eyes effectively provides the same information as the previous topic by adding the previous topic as a ( pseudo -) social cue . We tried this , and child.eyes and previous.topic do in fact seem to convey very similar information : e.g ., the model with previous.topic and without child.eyes scores essentially the same as the model with all social cues.
Our work instantiates the strategy of investigating the structure of children?s learning environment using ? ideal learner ? models . We used our models to investigate scientific questions about the role of social cues in grounded language learning . Because the performance of all four models studied in this paper improve dramatically when provided with social cues in all ten evaluation metrics , this paper provides strong support for the view that social cues are a crucial information source for grounded language learning.
We also showed that the importance of the different social cues in grounded language learning can be evaluated using ? add one cue ? and ? subtract one cue ? methodologies . According to both of these , the child.eyes cue is the most important of the five social cues studied here . There are at least two possible reasons for this : the caregiver?s topic could be determined by the child?s gaze , or the child.eyes cue could be providing our models with information about the topic of the previous utterance.
Incorporating topic continuity and anaphoric dependencies into our models would be likely to improve performance . This improvement might also help us distinguish the two hypotheses about the child.eyes cue . If the child.eyes cue is just providing indirect information about topic continuity , then the importance of the child.eyes cue should decrease when we incorporate topic continuity into our models . But if the child?s gaze is in fact determining the care-giver?s topic , then child.eyes should remain a strong cue even when anaphoric dependencies and topic continuity are incorporated into our models.
