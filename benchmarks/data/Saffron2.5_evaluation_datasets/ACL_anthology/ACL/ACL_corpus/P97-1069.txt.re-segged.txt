This paper shows that a class of Combinatory Categorial Grammars  ( CCGs ) augmented with a linguistically motivated form of typeraising involving variables is weakly equivalent to the standard CCGs not involving variables  . The proof is based on the idea that any instance of such a grammar can be simulated by a standard 

1 Introduction
The class of Combinatory Categorial Grammars ( CCG-Std ) was proved to be weakly equivalent to Linear Index Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars  ( Joshi , Vijay-Shanker , and Weir , 1991; Vijay-Shanker and Weir ,  1994) . 
But CCG-Std cannot handle the generalization of typeraising that has been used in accounting for various linguistic phenomena including : coordination and extraction  ( Steedman , 1985; Dowty , 1988; Steedman ,  1996) , prosody ( Prevost and Steedman ,  1993) , and quantifier scope ( Park ,  1995) . Intuitively , all of these phenomena call for a nontraditional , more flexible notion of consti-tuency capable of representing surface structures inclu-ding "  ( Subj V )   ( Obj ) " in English . Although lexical typeraising involving variables can be introduced to derive such a constituent ? unconstrained use of variables can increase the power  . For example , a grammar involving ( T\z )  /  ( T\v ) can generate a language A"B"C"D"E"which CCG-Std cannot  ( Hoffman ,  1993) . 
This paper argues that there is a class of grammars which allows the use of linguistically motivated form of typeraising involving variables while it is still weakly equivalent oCCG-Std  . A class of grammars , CCG-GTRC , is introduced in the next section as an extension to CCG-Std  . Then we show that CCG-GTRC can actually be simulated by a CCG-Std  , proving the equivalence .

I Our lexieal rules to introduce typeraising are nonrecursive and thus do not suffer from the problem of the overgeneration discussed in  ( Carpenter ,  1991) . 
2 CCGs with Generalized Type-Raised
Categories
In languages like Japanese , multiple NPs can easily form a nontraditional constituent as in "\[  ( SubjIObjl )  &  ( Subj2 Obj2 ) \] Verb " . The proposed ~ ammars ( CCG-GTRC ) admit lexical type-raised categories ( LTRC ) of the form "1"/ ( T\a ) or ' l'\ ( T/a ) where T is a variable over categories and a is a constant category  ( Const )  . 2 Then , composition of LTRCs can give rise to a class of categories having the form T/  ( T\a . . . . \ at ) or T \ ( T/a . . . . / at ) , representing a multiple-NP constituent exemplified by " SubjlObjt "  . 
We call these categories generalized type-raised categories  ( GTRC ) and each ai of a GTRC an argument ( of the GTRC )  . 
The introduction of GTRCs affects the use of combinatory rules : functional application "> : z /y + y ---  , z " and generalized functional composition "> B ~   ( x ) : z/y + ylzt . . . \[ zk---zlzl . . . \[ z ~" where k is bounded by a grammar-dependent kma ~ as in CCG-Std  .   3 This paper assumes two constraints defined for the grammars and one condition stipulated to control the formal properties  . 
The following order-preserving constraint , which follows more primitive directionality features  ( Steedman ,  1991) , limits the directions of the slashes in GTRCs . 
(1) In a GTRC"1"\[ o(T\[,a . . . . Ira , ) , the direction of \[0 must be the opposite to any of In ,   . . . , \] b This prohibits functional composition '> B ?' on ' GTRC+GTRC ' pairs so that " T/  ( T\A\B ) + U\ ( U/C/D ) " does not result in T\ ( T\A\B/C/D ) or U/ ( UIC/D\A\B )   . That is , no movement of arguments across the functor is allowed  . 
The variable constraint states that : ( 2 ) Variables are limited to the defined positions in

This prohibits '> Bk ( ? ) ' with k > I on the pair 2Categories are in the " result-leftmost " representation ad associatelf t  . Thus a/b/c should be read as ( a/b ) /c and returns a/b when an argument c is applied to its right  . A . . . . . Z stand for nonterminals and a , . . . , z for complex , constant categories . 
3 There are also backward rules ( < ) that are analogous to forward rules ( > )  . Crossing rules where zt is found in the direction opposite of that of y are labelled with ' x '  . ' k ' re-presents the number of arguments being passed  . '\[' stands for a directional metavariable for / ,  \ . 
513 ' Const+GTRC ' . For example , '> B2' on " A/B+T/ ( TkC ) " cannot realize the unification of the form " A/B + TrIT e  . /( TtITz\C ) " ( with T = TilT , _) resulting in " AIT ,  . /(BITz\C)" . 
In order to assure the expected generative capacity  , we place a condition on the use of rules . The condition can be viewed in a way comparable to those on rewriting rules to define  , say , contextfree grammars . The bounded argument condition ensures that every argument category is bounded as follows :  ( 3 ) '> B ( x ) ' should not apply to the pair ' Const+GTRC ' . 
For example , this prohibits " A/B+T ~( TkC . . . .\Ct ) -- A/(B\C , . .  . \Cl ) " , where the underlined argument can be unboundedly arge  . These constraints and condition also tell us how we can implement a CCG-GTRC system without overgeneration  . 
The possible cases of combinatory ule application are summarized as follows:  ( 4 ) a . For ' Const+Const ' , the same rules as in CCG-Std are applicable . 
b . For ' GTRC + Const ' , the applicable rules are : ( i ) > : e . g . , " T/ ( TkAkB ) + SkAkB -- S " ( ii ) > B k ( x ) : e . g . , " T/(TkA\B ) +
SkA\BkC/D- . S\C/D'"c . For ' Const+GTRC ', only ' >' is possible : e . g . , " S/(S/(S\B )) + r/(T\B)--,S"d . For ' GTRC + GTRC' , the possibilities are : ( i ) > : e . g . , " T/(mx(S/A/B )) + Tk(T/A/B)(ii ) > B : e . g . , " T/(T\A\B ) + T/(T\C\D)- . 

CCG-GTRC is defined below where g , ta and ~ a , rc represent the classes of the instances of CCG -Std and CCG- 
GTRC , respectively:
Definition 1G at rc is the collection of G's ( extension of a GEG , ta ) such that : l . For the lexical function f of G ( from terminals to sets of categories )  , if a Ef(a ) , f ' may additionally include ( a , T/(T\a )) , ( a , T\(T/a )) . 
2. G ' may include the rule schemata in (4).
The main claim of the paper is the following : Proposition  1   ~9*~e is weakly equivalent with ~ , ta . 
We show the nontrivial direction : for any G'E Ggt ~ c  , there is a G"6~ , , a such that L ( G ') = L ( G ") . As G ' corresponds to a unique GE ~ , ta , we extend G " from G to simulate G ' , then show that the languages are exactly the same . 
3 Simulation of CCG-GTRC
Consider a fragment of CCG-GTRC with a lexical function f such that f  ( a ) = A , T/(T\A ) , f(b ) = A , T/(TkA ) , f (?) = SNA\B . This fragment can generate the following two permutations :  ( 5 ) a . ~b ?,/( T\a ) +> S\A > $ b . bacr/(r\B ) + r/(r\a)+s\a\8 . > BX
S\B >

Notice that ( 5b ) cannot be generated by the original CCG-Std where the lexicon does not involve GTRCs  . In order to ( statically ) simulate ( 5b ) by a CCG-Std , we add S\B kA to the value of f " ( c ) in the lexicon of G ' . Let us call this type of relation between the original S\A\B and the S\B\]\A\]wrapping  , due to its resemblance to the new operation of the same name in  ( Bach ,  1979) . There are two potential problems with this simple augmentation  . 
First , wrapping may affect unboundedly ong chunks of categories as exemplified in  ( 6 )  . Second , the simulation may overgenerate . We discuss these issues in turn . 
(6) " T/(T\A ) + T/(TkB ) + .   .   . + T/(T\A ) + T/(T\B)+s\a\B .   .   . \ a\B\c-s\c " We need S\~--\AXB . . . kAkB 1 which can be the result of unboundedly-long compositions  , to simulate (6) without depending on the GTRCs . Intuitively , this situation is analogous to long-distance movement of C from the position left of SkA kB  . . . kC to the sentence-initial position . 
In order to deal with the first problem , the following key properties of CCG-GTRC must be observed :  ( 7 ) a . Any derived category is a combination of lexical categories  . For example , SkA kB\A\B . . . \AkBkC may be derived from " SkA kBkC + . . . + SkAkBkS + SkAkBkS " by ' < B' . 
b . Wrapping can occur only when GTRCs are invol-ved in the use of '> Bkx ' and can only cross at most km ~= arguments  . Since there are only finitely-many argument categories  , the argument ( s ) being passed can be encoded in a finite store . 
For derivable categories bounded by the maximum number of arguments of a lexical category  , we add all the instances of wrapping required for simulating the effect of GTRC into the lexicon of G "  . For the unbounded case , we extend the lexicon as in the following example  :   ( 8 ) a . For a category S\A\B\C , add S\c\AkB to the lexicon . 
b . For SkA\BkS , add S\c\A\BkS\c,
S\A\B\C\S\c . . . . . S\C ~\ S\c.
S\c is a new category representing the situation where \ C is being passed across categories  . Thus\C which originated in SkA kB\C in ( a ) may be passed onto another compositions as follows:  ( 9 ) S\c\A\B + S\c\A\B\S\c + . . . + S\~S\c- . -S\GJ\A\B . . . \ A\B\A\B Now , both of the permutations in ( 5 ) can be derived in this extension of CCG-Std . The finite lexicon with finite extension assures the termination of the process  . This covers the case (4bii ) . 
Case ( 4e ) can be characterized by a general pattern " cl ( hi ( b\ak . . . \ a ,)) + T/(T\ak .   .   . \ a ,) --* c " where T = b . Since any argument category is bounded , we can add b/(b\ak . . . \ a ~) 6f '( al .   .   . a , ) in the lexicon as an idiom . 
The other cases do not require simulation as the same string can be derived in the original grammar  . 
The second problem of overgeneration calls for another step  . Suppose that the lexicon includes jr ( c ) = S\A\B , f(d ) = S\B\A , and f ( e ) = E\ ( S\B\A ) and that S\BF ~ is added to f ( c ) by wrapping . To avoid generating an illegal string " ce " ( in addition to the legal " de " )   , we label the state of wrapping as S\B t + ~ o , ~ pl\[\A ~+ , ~ ,  . ~ , p\]t The original entries can be labelled as S \ Bt  .   .   .   . p\]\A\[ .   .   .   . pj and E\(S\B\[ .   .   .   . p j\A\[ .   .   .   . pl ) . The lexical , argument categories , e . g . , A , are underspecified with respect to the feature . Since finite features can be folded into a category  , this can be written as a CCG-Std without features . 
4 Equivalence of the Two Languages
Proposition I can be proved by the following lemma  ( as a special case where c =  S ) : Lemma 1 For any G'6Ggtre ( an extension of G )  , there is a G"6~ , td such that a string w is derivable from a constant category c in G ' iff  ( ~ ) w is derivable from c in
Gll ?
The sketch of the proof goes as follows . First , we construct G " from G ' as in the previous ection  . Both directions of the lemma can be proved by induction on the height of derivation  . Consider the direction of '--- . ' . The base ( lexical ) case holds by definition of the grammars . 
For the induction step , we consider each case of rule application in (4) . Case ( 4a ) allows direct application of the induction hypothesis for the substructure of smaller height starting with a constant category  . Other cases involve GTRC and require sublemmas which can be proved by induction on the length of the GTRC  . Cases (4 hi , d i ) have a differently-branching derivation in G " but can be derived without simulation  . Cases (4bii , c ) depend on the simulation of the previou section . Case ( 4 d i i ) only appears in sublemmas as the result category is GTRC  . In each sublemma , the induction hypothesis of Lemma 1 is applied ( mutually recursively ) to handle the derivations of the smaller substructures from a constant category  . 
A similar proof is applicable to the other direction  . 
The special cases in this direction involves the feature \[+ wrap \] and/or the new categories of the form ' z  . . . ' which record the argument(s ) being passed . As before , we need sublemmas to handle each case . The proof of the sublemma involving the ' z . . . ' form can be done by induction on the length of the category  . 
5 Conclusion
We have shown that CCG-GTRC as formulated above is weakly equivalent to CCG-Std  . The results support he use of typeraising involving variables in accounting for various linguistic phenomena  . Other related results to be reported in the future include :  ( i ) an extension o\[the po-lynomial parsing algorithm of  ( Vijay-Shanker and Weir , 1990) for CCG-Std to CCG-GTRC ( Komagata ,  1997) ,   ( ii ) application to a Japanese parser which is capable of handling nontraditional constituents and information structure  ( roughly , topic/focustructure ) . An extension of the formalism is also being studied  , to include lexi-ca/typeraising of the form T/ ( T\c ) ld  ~ . . . Id ~ for English prepositions/articles and Japanese particles  .
