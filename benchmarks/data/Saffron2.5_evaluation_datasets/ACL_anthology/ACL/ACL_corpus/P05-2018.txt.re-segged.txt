Abstract
In this paper , we study different centrality measures being used in predicting noun phrases appearing in the abstracts of scientific articles . Our experimental results show that centrality measures improve the accuracy of the prediction in terms of both precision and recall . We also found that the method of constructing Noun Phrase Network significantly influences the accuracy when using the centrality heuristics itself , but is negligible when it is used together with other text features in decision trees.
1 Introduction
Research on text summarization , information retrieval , and information extraction often faces the question of how to determine which words are more significant than others in text . Normally we only consider content words , i.e ., the open class words . Non-content words or stop words , which are called function words in natural language processing , do not convey semantics so that they are excluded although they sometimes appear more frequently than content words . A content word is usually defined as a term , although a term can also be a phrase . Its significance is often indicated by Term Frequency ( TF ) and Inverse Document Frequency ( IDF ). The usage of TF comes from ? the simple notion that terms which occur frequently in a document may reflect its meaning more strongly than terms that occur less frequently ? ( Jurafsky and Martin , 2000). On the contrary , IDF assigns smaller weights to terms which are contained in more documents . That is simply because ? the more documents having the term , the less useful the term is in discriminating those documents having it from those not having it ? ( Yu and Meng , 1998).
TF and IDF also find their usage in automatic text summarization . In this circumstance , TF is used individually more often than together with IDF , since the term is not used to distinguish a document from another . Automatic text summarization seeks a way of producing a text which is much shorter than the document(s ) to be summarized , and can serve as a surrogate for fulltext.
Thus , for extractive summaries , i.e ., summaries composed of original sentences from the text to be summarized , we try to find those terms which are more likely to be included in the summary.
The overall goal of our research is to build a machine learning framework for automatic text summarization . This framework will learn the relationship between text documents and their corresponding abstracts written by human . At the current stage the framework tries to generate a sentence ranking function and use it to produce extractive summaries . It is important to find a set of features which represent most information in a sentence and hence the machine learning mechanism can work on it to produce a ranking function . The next stage in our research will be to use the framework to generate abstractive summaries , i.e . summaries which do not use sentences from the input text verbatim . Therefore , it is important to know what terms should be included in the summary.
In this paper we present the approach of using social network analysis technique to find terms , specifically noun phrases ( NPs ) in our experiments , which occur in the human-written abstracts.
We show that centrality measures increase the prediction accuracy . Two ways of constructing noun future work are discussed at the end.
2 Centrality Measures
Social network analysis studies linkages among social entities and the implications of these linkages . The social entities are called actors . A social network is composed of a set of actors and the relation or relations defined on them ( Wasserman and Faust , 1994). Graph theory has been used in social network analysis to identify those actors who impose more influence upon a social network . A social network can be represented by a graph with the actors denoted by the nodes and the relations by the edges or links . To determine which actors are prominent , a measure called centrality is introduced . In practice , four types of centrality are often used.
Degree centrality measures how many direct connections a node has to other nodes in a network . Since this measure depends on the size of the network , a standardized version is used when it is necessary to compare the centrality across networks of different sizes.
DegreeCentrality(ni ) = d(ni)/(u-1), where d(ni ) is the degree of node i in a network and u is the number of nodes in that network.
Closeness centrality focuses on the distances an actor is from all other nodes in the network.
?ui i jj=1ClosenessCentrality(n ) = ( u - 1) d(n , n ) , where d(ni , nj ) is the shortest distance between node i and j.
Betweenness centrality emphasizes that for an actor to be central , it must reside on many geodesics of other nodes so that it can control the interactions between them . ? jk i jk j<k i g ( n ) / g
BetweennessCentrality(n ) = ( u - 1)(u - 2) / 2 , where gjk is the number of geodesics linking node j and k , gjk(ni ) is the number of geodesics linking the two nodes that contain node i.
Betweenness centrality is widely used because of its generality . This measure assumes that information flow between two nodes will be on the geodesics between them . Nevertheless , ? It is quite possible that information will take a more circui-tous route either by random communication or [ by being ] channeled through many intermediaries in order to ' hide ' or ' shield ' information ?. ( Stephenson and Zelen , 1989).
Stephenson and Zelen (1989) developed information centrality which generalizes betweenness centrality . It focuses on the information contained in all paths originating with a specific actor . The calculation for information centrality of a node is in the Appendix.
Recently centrality measures have started to gain attention from researchers in text processing.
Corman et al (2002) use vectors , which consist of NPs , to represent texts and hence analyze mutual relevance of two texts . The values of the elements in a vector are determined by the betweenness centrality of the NPs in a text being analyzed . Erkan and Radev (2004) use the PageRank method , which is the application of centrality concept to the Web , to determine central sentences in a cluster for summarization . Vanderwende et al (2004) also use the PageRank method to pick prominent triples , i.e.
(node i , relation , node j ), and then use the triples to generate event-centric summaries.
3 NP Networks
To construct a network for NPs in a text , we try two ways of modeling the relation between them.
One is at the sentence level : if two noun phrases can be sequentially parsed out from a sentence , a link is added between them . The other way is at the document level : we simply add a link to every pair of noun phrases which are parsed out in succession . The difference between the two ways is that the network constructed at the sentence level ignores the existence of certain connections between sentences.
We process a text document in four steps.
First , the text is tokenized and stored into an internal representation with structural information.
Second , the tokenized text is tagged by the Brill tagging algorithm POS tagger.1 Third , the NPs in a text document are parsed according to 35 parsing rules as shown in Figure 1. If a new noun phrase is found , a new node is formed and added to the network . If the noun phrase already exists in the network , the node containing it will be identified . A link will be added between two nodes if they are parsed out sequentially for 1 The POS tagger we used can be obtained from http://web.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montytagger / quentially in the same sentence for the network formed at the sentence level.
Finally , after the text document has been processed , the centrality of each node in the network is updated.
4 Predicting NPs Occurring in Abstracts
In this paper , we refer the NPs occur both in a text document and its corresponding abstract as Cooccurring NPs ( CNPs).
4.1 CMP-LG Corpus
In our experiment , a corpus of 183 documents was used . The documents are from the Computation and Language collection and have been marked in XML with tags providing basic information about the document such as title , author , abstract , body , sections , etc . This corpus is a part of the TIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation Conference ( SUMMAC ) effort acting as a general resource to the information retrieval , extraction and summarization communities . We excluded five documents from this corpus which do not have abstracts.
4.2 Using Noun Phrase Centrality Heuristics We assume that a noun phrase with high centrality is more likely to be a central topic being addressed in a document than one with low centrality . Given this assumption , we performed an experiment , in which the NPs with highest centralities are retrieved and compared with the actual NPs in the abstracts . To evaluate this method , we use Precision , which measures the fraction of true CNPs in all predicted CNPs , and Recall , which measures the fraction of correctly predicted CNPs in all
CNPs.
After establishing the NP network for a document and ranking the nodes according to their centralities , we must decide how many NPs should be retrieved . This number should not be too big ; otherwise the Precision value will be very low , although the Recall will be higher . If this number is very small , the Recall will decrease correspondingly . We adopted a compound metric ? Fmeasure , to balance the selection : Based on our study of 178 documents in the CMP-LG corpus , we find that the number of CNPs is roughly proportional to the number of NPs in the abstract . We obtain a linear regression model for the data shown in Figure 2 and use this model to calculate the number of nodes we should retrieve from the NP network , given the number of NPs in the abstract known a priori : One could argue that the number of abstract NPs is unknown a priori and thus the proposed method is of limited use . However , the user can provide an estimate based on the desired number of words in the summary . Here we can adopt the same way of asking the user to provide a limit for the NPs in the summary . We used the actual number of NPs the author used in his/her abstract in our experiment.

Number of Common NPs = 0.555 * Number of NPs in Abstract + 2.435 be composed of disconnected subgraphs . In such case , we calculate the closeness centrality ( cc ), betweenness centrality ( bc ), and the information centrality ( ic ) within the subgraphs while the degree centrality ( dc ) is still computed for the overall graph . In 3(b ), the network is constructed at the document level . Therefore , it is guaranteed that every node is reachable from all other node.
Figure 3(a ) shows the simplest centrality measure dc performs best , with Precision , Recall , and Fmeasure all greater than 0.2, which are twice of bc and almost ten times of cc and ic.
In Figure 3(b ), however , all four measures are around 0.25 in all three evaluation metrics . This result suggests to us that when we choose a centrality to represent the prominence of a NP in the text , not only does the kind of the centrality matter , but also the way of forming the NP network.
Overall , the heuristic of using centrality itself does not achieve impressive scores . We will see in the next section that using decision trees is a much better way to perform the predictions , when using centrality together with other text features.
4.3 Using Decision Trees
We obtain the following features for all NPs in a document from the CMP-LG corpus : Position : the order of a NP appearing in the text , normalized by the total number of NPs.
Article : three classes are defined for this attribute : INDEfinite ( contains a or an ), DEFInite ( contains the ), and NONE ( all others).
Degree centrality : obtained from the NP network Closeness centrality : obtained from the NP network Betweenness centrality : obtained from the NP network Information centrality : obtained from the NP network Head noun POS tag : a head noun is the last word in the NP . Its POS tag is used here.
Proper name : whether the NP is a proper name , by looking at the POS tags of all words in the NP.
Number : whether the NP is just one number.
Frequency : how many times a NP occurs in a text , normalized by its maximum.
In abstract : whether the NP appears in the author-provided abstract . This attribute is the target for the decision trees to classify.

In order to learn which type of centrality measures helps to improve the accuracy of the predictions , and to see whether centrality measures are better than term frequency , we experiment with six groups of feature sets and compare their performances . The six groups are:
All : including all features above.
DC : including only the degree centrality measure , and other non-centrality measures except for Frequency.
CC : same as DC except for using closeness centrality instead of degree centrality.
BC : same as DC except for using betweenness centrality instead of degree centrality.
IC : same as DC except for using information centrality instead of degree centrality.
FQ : including Frequency and all other non-centrality features.
The 178 documents have generated more than 100,000 training records . Among them only a very small portion (2.6%) belongs to the positive class.
When using decision tree algorithm on such imbalanced attribute , it is very common that the class with absolute advantages will be favored ( Japkowicz , 2000; Kubat and Matwin , 1997).

Table 1. Results for Using 6 Feature Sets with YaDT the unfair preference , one way is to boost the weak class , e.g ., by replicating instances in the minority class ( Kubat and Matwin , 1997; Chawla et al , 2000). In our experiments , the 178 documents were arbitrarily divided into three roughly equal groups , generating 36,157, 37,600, and 34,691 records , respectively . After class balancing , the records are increased to 40,109, 42,210, and 38,499.
The three data sets were then run through the decision tree algorithm YaDT ( Yet another Decision Tree builder ), which is much more efficient than C4.5 ( Ruggieri , 2004),2 with 10-fold cross validation.
The experiment results of using YaDT with three data sets and six feature groups to predict the CNPs are shown in Table 1. The mean values of three metrics are also shown in Figure 4(a ) and 4(b ). Decision trees achieve much higher scores compared with the scores obtained by using centrality heuristics . Together with other text features , DC , CC , BC , and IC obtain scores over 0.7 in all three metric , which are comparable to the scores obtained by using FQ . Moreover , when using all the features , decision trees achieve over 0.8 in precision and over 0.95 in recall . Fmeasure is as high as 0.88. To see whether Fmeasure of All is statistically better than that of other settings , we run t-tests to compare them using values of Fmeasure obtained in the 10-fold crossvalidation from the three data sets . The results show the mean value of Fmeasure of All is significantly higher ( pvalue =0.000) than that of other settings.
Differently from the experiments that use centrality heuristics by itself , almost no obvious distinctions 2 The YaDT software can be obtained from http://www.di.unipi.it/~ruggieri/software.html can be observed when comparing the performances of YaDT with NP network formed in two ways.
5 Conclusions and Future work
We have studied four kinds of centrality measures in order to identify prominent noun phrases in text documents . Overall , the centrality heuristic itself does not demonstrate its superiority . Among four centrality measures , degree centrality performs the best in the heuristic when the NP network is constructed at the sentence level , which indicates other centrality measures obtained from the subgraphs can not represent very well the prominence of the NPs in the global NP network . When the NP network is constructed at the document level , the differences between the centrality measures become negligible . However , networks formed at the document level overlook the connections between sentences as there is only one kind of link ; on the other hand , NP networks formed at the sentence level ignore connections between sentences . We plan to extend our study to construct NP networks with weighted links . The key problem will be how to determine the weights for links between two NPs in the same sentence , in the same paragraph but different sentences , and in different paragraphs.
We consider introducing the concept of entropy from Information Theory to solve this problem.
In our experiments with YaDT , it seems the ways of forming NP network are not critical . We learn that , at least in this circumstance , the decision trees algorithm is more robust than the centrality heuristic . When using all features in YaDT , recall reaches 0.95, which means the decision trees find out 95% of CNPs in the abstracts from the text documents , without increasing mistakes as the

FQ precision is improved at the same time . Using all features in YaDT achieves better results than using centrality feature or frequency individually with other features implies centrality features may capture somewhat different information from the text.
To make this research more robust , we will include reference resolution into our study . We will also include centrality measures as sentence features in producing extractive summaries.
