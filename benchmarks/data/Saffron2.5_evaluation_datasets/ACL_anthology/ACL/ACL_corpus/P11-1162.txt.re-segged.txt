Abstract
Text mining and data harvesting algorithms have become popular in the computational linguistics community . They employ patterns that specify the kind of information to be harvested , and usually bootstrap either the pattern learning or the term harvesting process ( or both ) in a recursive cycle , using data learned in one step to generate more seeds for the next.
They therefore treat the source text corpus as a network , in which words are the nodes and relations linking them are the edges . The results of computational network analysis , especially from the world wide web , are thus applicable . Surprisingly , these results have not yet been broadly introduced into the computational linguistics community . In this paper we show how various results apply to text mining , how they explain some previously observed phenomena , and how they can be helpful for computational linguistics applications.
1 Introduction
Text mining / harvesting algorithms have been applied in recent years for various uses , including learning of semantic constraints for verb participants ( Lin and Pantel , 2002) related pairs in various relations , such as part-whole ( Girju et al , 2003), cause ( Pantel and Pennacchiotti , 2006), and other typical information extraction relations , large collections of entities ( Soderland et al , 1999; Etzioni et al , 2005), features of objects ( Pasca , 2004) and ontologies ( Carlson et al , 2010). They generally start with one or more seed terms and employ patterns that specify the desired information as it relates to the seed(s ). Several approaches have been developed specifically for learning patterns , including guided pattern collection with manual filtering ( Riloff and Shepherd , 1997) automated surface-level pattern induction ( Agichtein and Gravano , 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy , 2002) probabilistic methods for taxonomy relation learning ( Snow et al , 2005) and kernel methods for relation learning ( Zelenko et al , 2003). Generally , the harvesting procedure is recursive , in which data ( terms or patterns ) gathered in one step of a cycle are used as seeds in the following step , to gather more terms or patterns.
This method treats the source text as a graph or network , consisting of terms ( words ) as nodes and inter-term relations as edges . Each relation type induces a different network1. Text mining is a process of network traversal , and faces the standard problems of handling cycles , ranking search alternatives , estimating yield maxima , etc.
The computational properties of large networks and large network traversal have been studied intensively ( Sabidussi , 1966; Freeman , 1979; Watts and Strogatz , 1998) and especially , over the past years , in the context of the world wide web ( Page et al , 1999; Broder et al , 2000; Kleinberg and Lawrence , 2001; Li et al , 2005; Clauset et al , 2009). Surprisingly , except in ( Talukdar and Pereira , 2010), this work has not yet been related to text mining research in the computational linguistics community.
The work is , however , relevant in at least two ways . It sometimes explains why text mining algo-1These networks are generally far larger and more densely interconnected than the world wide web?s network of pages and hyperlinks.

In Section 2, we review some related work . In Section 3 we describe the general harvesting procedure , and follow with an examination of the various statistical properties of implicit semantic networks in Section 4, using our implemented harvester to provide illustrative statistics . In Section 5 we discuss implications for computational linguistics research.
2 Related Work
The Natural Language Processing knowledge harvesting community has developed a good understanding of how to harvests various kinds of semantic information and use this information to improve the performance of tasks such as information extraction ( Riloff , 1993), textual entailment ( Zanzotto et al , 2006), question answering ( Katz et al ., 2003), and ontology creation ( Suchanek et al , 2007), among others . Researchers have focused on the automated extraction of semantic lexicons ( Hearst , 1992; Riloff and Shepherd , 1997; Girju et al ., 2003; Pasca , 2004; Etzioni et al , 2005; Kozareva et al , 2008). While clustering approaches tend to extract general facts , pattern based approaches have shown to produce more constrained but accurate lists of semantic terms . To extract this information , ( Lin and Pantel , 2002) showed the effect of using different sizes and genres of corpora such as news and Web documents . The latter has been shown to provide broader and more complete information.
Researchers outside computational linguistics have studied complex networks such as the World Wide Web , the Social Web , the network of scientific papers , among others . They have investigated the properties of these textbased networks with the objective of understanding their structure and applying this knowledge to determine node impor-tance/centrality , connectivity , growth and decay of interest , etc . In particular , the ability to analyze networks , identify influential nodes , and discover hidden structures has led to important scientific and technological breakthroughs such as the discovery of communities of like-minded individuals ( Newman and Girvan , 2004), the identification of influential people ( Kempe et al , 2003), the ranking of scientists by their citation indexes ( Radicchi et al , 2009), and the discovery of important scientific papers ( Walker et al , 2006; Chen et al , 2007; Sayyadi and Getoor , 2009). Broder et al (2000) demonstrated that the Web link structure has a ? bow-tie ? shape , while (2001) classified Web pages into authorities ( pages with relevant information ) and hubs ( pages with useful references ). These findings resulted in the development of the PageRank ( Page et al ., 1999) algorithm which analyzes the structure of the hyperlinks of Web documents to find pages with authoritative information . PageRank has revolutionized the whole Internet search society.
However , noone has studied the properties of the textbased semantic networks induced by semantic relations between terms with the objective of understanding their structure and applying this knowledge to improve concept discovery . Most relevant to this theme is the work of Steyvers and Tenenbaum ( Steyvers and Tenenbaum , 2004), who studied three manually built lexical networks ( association norms , WordNet , and Roget?s Thesaurus ( Roget , 1911)) and proposed a model of the growth of the semantic structure over time . These networks are limited to the semantic relations among nouns.
In this paper we take a step further to explore the statistical properties of semantic networks relating proper names , nouns , verbs , and adjectives . Understanding the semantics of nouns , verbs , and adjectives has been of great interest to linguists and cognitive scientists such as ( Gentner , 1981; Levin and Somers , 1993; Gasser and Smith , 1998). We implement a general harvesting procedure and show its results for these word types . A fundamental difference with the work of ( Steyvers and Tenenbaum , 2004) is that we study very large semantic networks built ? naturally ? by ( millions of ) users rather than ? artificially ? by a small set of experts . The large networks capture the semantic intuitions and knowledge of the collective mass . It is conceivable that an analysis of this knowledge can begin to form the basis of a largescale theory of semantic meaning and its interconnections , support observation of the process of lexical development and usage in humans , and even suggest explanations of how knowledge is organized in our brains , especially when performed for differ-3 Inducing Semantic Networks in the Web Text mining algorithms such as those mentioned above raise certain questions , such as : Why are some seed terms more powerful ( provide a greater yield ) than others ?, How can one find high-yield terms ?, How many steps does one need , typically , to learn all terms for a given relation ?, Can one estimate the total eventual yield of a given relation ?, and so on.
On the face of it , one would need to know the structure of the network a priori to be able to provide answers . But research has shown that some surprising regularities hold . For example , in the text mining community , ( Kozareva and Hovy , 2010b ) have shown that one can obtain a quite accurate estimate of the eventual yield of a pattern and seed after only five steps of harvesting . Why is this ? They do not provide an answer , but research from the network community does.
To illustrate the properties of networks of the kind induced by semantic relations , and to show the applicability of network research to text harvesting , we implemented a harvesting algorithm and applied it to a representative set of relations and seeds in two languages.
Since the goal of this paper is not the development of a new text harvesting algorithm , we implemented a version of an existing one : the socalled DAP ( doubly-anchored pattern ) algorithm ( Kozareva et al ., 2008), because it (1) is easy to implement , (2) requires minimum input ( one pattern and one seed example ), (3) achieves very high precision compared to existing methods ( Pasca , 2004; Etzioni et al ., 2005; Pasca , 2007), (4) enriches existing semantic lexical repositories such as WordNet and Yago ( Suchanek et al , 2007), (5) can be formulated to learn semantic lexicons and relations for noun , verb and verb+preposition syntactic constructions ; (6) functions equally well in different languages.
Next we describe the knowledge harvesting procedure and the construction of the text-mined semantic networks.
3.1 Harvesting to Induce Semantic Networks For a given semantic class of interest say singers , the algorithm starts with a seed example of the class , say Madonna . The seed term is inserted in the lexicosyntactic pattern ? class such as seed and *?, which learns on the position of the ? new terms of type class . The newly learned terms are then individually placed into the position of the seed in the pattern , and the bootstrapping process is repeated until no new terms are found . The output of the algorithm is a set of terms for the semantic class . The algorithm is implemented as a breadth-first search and its mechanism is described as follows : 1. Given : a language L={English , Spanish } a pattern Pi={such as , including , verb prep , noun } a seed term seed for Pi 2. Build a query for Pi using template Ti ? class such as seed and *?, ? class including seed and *?, ?* and seed verb prep ?, ?* and seed noun ?, ? seed and * noun ? 3. Submit Ti to Yahoo ! or other search engine 4. Extract terms occupying the * position 5. Feed terms from 4. into 2.
6. Repeat steps 2?5. until no new terms are found The output of the knowledge harvesting algorithm is a network of semantic terms interconnected by the semantic relation captured in the pattern . We can represent the traversed ( implicit ) network as a directed graph G(V,E ) with nodes V (| V | = n ) and edges E(|E | = m ). A node u in the network corresponds to a term discovered during bootstrapping . An edge ( u , v ) ? E represents an existing link between two terms . The direction of the edge indicates that the term v was generated by the term u . For example , given the sentence ( where the pattern is in italics and the extracted term is underlined ) ? He loves singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson ?, two nodes Madonna and Michael Jackson with an edge e=(Madonna , Michael Jackson ) would be created in the graph G . Figure 1 shows a small example of the singer network . The starting seed term Madonna is shown in red color and the harvested terms are in blue.
3.2 Data

Kozareva and Hovy , 2010a ): ? semantic classes that can be learned using different seeds ( e.g ., ? singers such as Madonna and *? and ? singers such as Placido Domingo and *?); ? semantic classes that are expressed through different lexicosyntactic patterns ( e.g ., ? weapons such as bombs and *? and ? weapons including bombs and *?); ? verbs and adjectives characterizing the semantic class ( e.g ., ? expensive and * car ?, ? dogs run and *?); ? semantic relations with more complex lexicosyntactic structure ( e.g ., ?* and Easyjet fly to ?, ?* and Sam live in ?); ? semantic classes that are obtained in different languages , such as English and Spanish ( e.g ., ? singers such as Madonna and *? and ? cantantes como Madonna y *?); While most of these variations have been explored in individual papers , we have found no paper that covers them all , and none whatsoever that uses verbs and adjectives as seeds.
Using the above procedure to generate the data , each pattern was submitted as a query to Ya-hoo!Boss . For each query the top 1000 text snippets were retrieved . The algorithm ran until exhaustion.
In total , we collected 10GB of data which was part-of-speech tagged with Treetagger ( Schmid , 1994) and used for the semantic term extraction . Table 1 summarizes the number of nodes and edges learned for each semantic network using pattern Pi and the initial seed shown in italics.

4 Statistical Properties of Text-Mined
Semantic Networks
In this section we apply a range of relevant measures from the network analysis community to the networks described above.
4.1 Centrality
The first statistical property we explore is centrality.
It measures the degree to which the network structure determines the importance of a node in the network ( Sabidussi , 1966; Freeman , 1979).
We explore the effect of two centrality measures : indegree and outdegree . The indegree of a node u denoted as indegree(u )= ? ( v , u ) considers the sum of all incoming edges to u and captures the ability of a semantic term to be discovered by other semantic terms . The outdegree of a node u denoted as outdegree(u )= ? ( u , v ) considers the number of outgoing edges of the node u and measures the ability of a semantic term to discover new terms . Intuitively , the more central the node u is , the more confident we are that it is a correct term.
Since harvesting algorithms are notorious for extracting erroneous information , we use the two centrality measures to rerank the harvested elements.
Table 2 shows the accuracy2 of the singer semantic terms at different ranks using the in and out degree measures . Consistently , outdegree outperforms indegree and reaches higher accuracy . This 2Accuracy is calculated as the number of correct terms at rank R divided by the total number of terms at rank R.
1619 shows that for the text-mined semantic networks , the ability of a term to discover new terms is more important than the ability to be discovered.

Table 2: Accuracy of the Singer Terms.
This poses the question ? What are the terms with high and low outdegree ??. Table 3 shows the top and bottom 10 terms of the semantic class.

Joni Mitchell Sarah
Table 3: Singer Term Ranking with Centrality Measures.
The nodes with high outdegree correspond to famous or contemporary singers . The lower-ranked nodes are mostly spelling errors such as Alanis Morisette and Christine Agulera , less known singers such as Buffy Sainte-Marie and Cece Winans , non-American singers such as Alejandro Sanz and France Gall , extractions due to part-of-speech tagging errors such as Billie Celebration , and general terms such as Peter and Sarah . Potentially , knowing which terms have a high outdegree allows one to rerank candidate seeds for more effective harvesting.
4.2 Power-law Degree Distribution
We next study the degree distributions of the networks . Similarly to the Web ( Broder et al , 2000) and social networks like Orkut and Flickr , the text-mined semantic networks also exhibit a power-law distribution . This means that while a few terms have a significantly high degree , the majority of the semantic terms have small degree . Figure 2 shows the indegree and outdegree distributions for different semantic classes , lexicosyntactic patterns , and languages ( English and Spanish ). For each semantic network , we plot the best-fitting power-law function ( Clauset et al , 2009) which fits well all degree distributions . Table 4 shows the power-law exponent values for all text-mined semantic networks.

P8 1.94 1.07 P17 2.90 1.20
P9 1.96 1.30
Table 4: Power-Law Exponents of Semantic Networks.
It is interesting to note that the indegree power-law exponents for all semantic networks fall within the same range (? in ? 2.4), and similarly for the outdegree exponents (? out ? 1.3). However , the values of the indegree and outdegree exponents differ from each other . This observation is consistent with Web degree distributions ( Broder et al , 2000).
The difference in the distributions can be explained by the link asymmetry of semantic terms : A discovering B does not necessarily mean that B will discover A . In the text-mined semantic networks , this asymmetry is caused by patterns of language use , such as the fact that people use first adjectives of the size and then of the color ( e.g ., big red car ), or prefer to place male before female proper names . Harvesting patterns should take into account this tendency.
4.3 Sparsity
Another relevant property of the semantic networks concerns sparsity . Following Preiss ( Preiss , 1999), a graph is sparse if | E | = O(|V | k ) and 1 < k < 2, where | E | is the number of edges and | V | is the number of nodes , otherwise the graph is dense . For the studied text-semantic networks , k is ? 1.08. Sparsity can be also captured through the density of the semantic network which is computed as | E|V ( V?1) . All networks have low density which suggests that the networks exhibit a sparse connectivity pattern . On average a node ( semantic term ) is connected to a very small percentage of other nodes . Similar behavior was reported for the WordNet and Roget?s semantic networks ( Steyvers and Tenenbaum , 2004).

4.4 Connectedness
For every network , we computed the strongly connected component ( SCC ) such that for all nodes ( semantic terms ) in the SCC , there is a path from any node to another node in the SCC considering the direction of the edges between the nodes . For each network , we found that there is only one SCC . The size of the component is shown in Table 5. Unlike WordNet and Roget?s semantic networks where the SCC consists 96% of all semantic terms , in the text-mined semantic networks only 12 to 55% of the terms are in the SCC . This shows that not all nodes can reach ( discover ) every other node in the network . This also explains the findings of ( Kozareva et al , 2008; Vyas et al , 2009) why starting with a good seed is important.
4.5 Path Lengths and Diameter
Next , we describe the properties of the shortest paths between the semantic terms in the SCC . The distance between two nodes in the SCC is measured as the length of the shortest path connecting the terms.
The direction of the edges between the terms is taken into consideration . The average distance is the average value of the shortest path lengths over all pairs of nodes in the SCC . The diameter of the SCC is calculated as the maximum distance over all pairs of nodes ( u , v ), such that a node v is reachable from node u . Table 5 shows the average distance and the diameter of the semantic networks.

Table 5: SCC , SCC Average Distance and SCC Diameter of the Semantic Networks.
The diameter shows the maximum number of steps necessary to reach from any node to any other , while the average distance shows the number of steps necessary on average . Overall , all networks have very short average path lengths and small diameters that are consistent with Watt?s finding for smallworld networks . Therefore , the yield of harvesting seeds can be predicted within five steps explaining ( Kozareva and Hovy , 2010b ; Vyas et al , 2009).
We also compute for any randomly selected node in the semantic network on average how many hops ( steps ) are necessary to reach from one node to another . Figure 3 shows the obtained results for some of the studied semantic networks.
4.6 Clustering
The clustering coefficient ( C ) is another measure to study the connectivity structure of the networks ( Watts and Strogatz , 1998). This measure captures the probability that the two neighbors of a randomly selected node will be neighbors . The clustering coefficient of a node u is calculated as Cu = | eij | ku(ku?1) 60 70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15Number of Nodes Distance ( Hops)Britney Spears ( verb harvesting ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11Number of Nodes Distance ( Hops)fruits ( adjective harvesting ) 0 50 100 150 200 Figure 3: Hop Plot of the Semantic Networks.
: vi , vj ? Nu , eij ? E , where ku is the total degree of the node u and Nu is the neighborhood of u . The clustering coefficient C for the whole semantic network is the average clustering coefficient of all its nodes , C = 1n ?
Ci . The value of the clustering coefficient ranges between [0, 1], where 0 indicates that the nodes do not have neighbors which are themselves connected , while 1 indicates that all nodes are connected . Table 6 shows the clustering coefficient for all text-mined semantic networks together with the number of closed and open triads3. The analysis suggests the presence of a strong local cluster , however there are few possibilities to form overlapping neighborhoods of nodes . The clustering coefficient of WordNet ( Steyvers and Tenenbaum , 2004) is similar to those of the text-mined networks.
4.7 Joint Degree Distribution
In social networks , understanding the preferential attachment of nodes is important to identify the speed with which epidemics or gossips spread . Similarly , we are interested in understanding how the nodes of the semantic networks connect to each other . For this purpose , we examine the Joint Degree Distribution ( JDD ) ( Li et al , 2005; Newman , 2003). JDD is approximated by the degree correlation function knn which maps the outdegree and the average 3A triad is three nodes that are connected by either two ( open triad ) or three ( closed triad ) directed ties.

indegree of all nodes connected to a node with that outdegree . High values of knn indicate that high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes ( forming a ? core ? in the network ), while lower values of knn suggest that the high-degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree ones.
Figure 4 shows the knn for the singer , whale , live in , cars , cantantes , and gente networks . The figure plots the outdegree and the average indegree of the semantic terms in the networks on a loglog scale.
We can see that for all networks the high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree ones.
This explains why text mining algorithms should focus their effort on high-degree nodes.
4.8 Assortivity
The property of the nodes to connect to other nodes with similar degrees can be captured through the assortivity coefficient r ( Newman , 2003). The range of r is [?1, 1]. A positive assortivity coefficient means that the nodes tend to connect to nodes of similar degree , while negative coefficient means that nodes are likely to connect to nodes with degree very different from their own . We find that the assortivi-tiy coefficient of our semantic networks is positive , ranging from 0.07 to 0.20. In this respect , the semantic networks differ from the Web , which has a negative assortivity ( Newman , 2003). This implies a difference in text mining and web search traversal strategies : since starting from a highly-connected seed term will tend to lead to other highly-connected terms , text mining algorithms should prefer depth-first traversal , while web search algorithms starting 1 10 1 10knn Outdegreecantantes 1 10 1 10knn Outdegree gente Figure 4: Joint Degree Distribution of the Semantic Networks.
from a highly-connected seed page should prefer a breadth-first strategy.
5 Discussion
The above studies show that many of the properties discovered of the network formed by the web hold also for the networks induced by semantic relations in text mining applications , for various semantic classes , semantic relations , and languages . We can therefore apply some of the research from network analysis to text mining.
The smallworld phenomenon , for example , holds that any node is connected to any other node in at most six steps . Since as shown in Section 4.5 the semantic networks also exhibit this phenomenon , we can explain the observation of ( Kozareva and Hovy , 2010b ) that one can quite accurately predict the relative ? goodness ? of a seed term ( its eventual total yield and the number of steps required to obtain that ) within five harvesting steps . We have shown that due to the strongly connected components in text mining networks , not all elements within the harvested graph can discover each other . This implies that harvesting algorithms have to be started with several seeds to obtain adequate Recall ( Vyas et al , 2009).
We have shown that centrality measures can be used successfully to rank harvested terms to guide the network traversal , and to validate the correctness of the harvested terms.
In the future , the knowledge and observations made in this study can be used to model the lexical usage of people over time and to develop new semantic search technology.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we describe the implicit ? hidden ? semantic network graph structure induced over the text of the web and other sources by the semantic relations people use in sentences . We describe how term harvesting patterns whose seed terms are harvested and then applied recursively can be used to discover these semantic term networks . Although these networks differ considerably from the web in relation density , type , and network size , we show , somewhat surprisingly , that the same power-law , smallworld effect , transitivity , and most other characteristics that apply to the web?s hyperlinked network structure hold also for the implicit semantic term graphs?certainly for the semantic relations and languages we have studied , and most probably for almost all semantic relations and human languages.
This rather interesting observation leads us to surmise that the hyperlinks people create in the web are of essentially the same type as the semantic relations people use in normal sentences , and that they form an extension of normal language that was not needed before because people did not have the ability within the span of a single sentence to ? embed ? structures larger than a clause?certainly not a whole other page?s worth of information . The principal exception is the academic citation reference ( lexicalized as ? see ?), which is not used in modern webpages.
Rather , the ? lexicalization ? now used is a formatting convention : the hyperlink is colored and often underlined , facilities offered by computer screens but not available to speech or easy in traditional typesetting.
