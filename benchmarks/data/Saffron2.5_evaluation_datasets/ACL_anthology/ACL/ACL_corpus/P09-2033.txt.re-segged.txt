Abstract
In CrossLanguage Information Retrieval ( CLIR ), Out-of-Vocabulary ( OOV ) detection and translation pair relevance evaluation still remain as key problems . In this paper , an Eng-lish-Chinese Bi-Directional OOV translation model is presented , which utilizes Web mining as the corpus source to collect translation pairs and combines supervised learning to evaluate their association degree . The experimental results show that the proposed model can successfully filter the most possible translation candidate with the lower computational cost , and improve the OOV translation ranking effect , especially for popular new words.
1 Introduction
In CrossLanguage Information Retrieval ( CLIR ), most of queries are generally composed of short terms , in which there are many Out-of-Vocabulary ( OOV ) terms like named entities , new words , terminologies and so on . The translation quality of OOVs directly influences the precision of querying relevant multilingual information . Therefore , OOV translation has become a very important and challenging issue in CLIR.
The translation of OOVs can either be acquired from parallel or comparable corpus ( Lee , 2006) or mining from Web ( Lu , 2004). However , how to evaluate the degree of association between source query term and its target translation is quite important . In this paper , an OOV translation model is established based on the combination pattern of Web mining and translation ranking . Given an OOV , its related information are gotten from search results by search engine , from which the possible translation terms in target language can be extracted and then ranked through supervised learning such as Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) and RankingSVM ( Cao , 2006). The basic framework of the translation model is shown in Figure 1.

2 Related Research Work
With the rapid growth of Web information , increasing new terms and terminologies cannot be found in bilingual dictionaries . The state-of-art OOV translation strategies tend to use Web itself as a big corpus ( Wang , 2004; Zhang , 2004). The quick and direct way of getting required information from Web pages is to use search engines , such as Google , Altavista or Yahoo . Therefore , many OOV translation models based on Web mining are proposed by researchers ( Fang , 2006;
Wu , 2007).
By introducing supervised learning mechanism , the relevance between original OOV term and extracted candidate translation can be accurately evaluated . Meanwhile , the model proposed exhibits better applicability and can also be applied in processing OOVs with different classes.
3 Chinese OOV Extraction based on
PAT-Tree
For a language that has no words boundary like Chinese , PAT-Tree data structure is adopted to extract OOV terms ( Chien , 1997). The most outstanding property of this structure is its Semi Infinite String , which can store all the semi-strings of whole corpus in a binary tree . In this tree , branch nodes indicate direction of search and frequency of semi infinite strings . With common strings being extracted , large amounts of noisy terms and fragments are also extracted.
For example , when searching for the translation of English abbreviation term ? FDA ?, some noisy Chinese terms are extracted , such as ????? (17 times ), ?????? (16 times ), ????? ?? (9 times ). In order to filter noisy fragments , the simplified Local-Maxima algorithm is used ( Wang , 2004).
4 Translation Ranking based on Supervised Learning 4.1 Ranking by Classification and Ordinal
Regression
Based on the extracted terms , the correct translation can be chosen further . A direct option is to rank them by their frequency or length . It works well when the OOV term has a unique meaning and all the Web snippets are about the same topic.
However , in much more cases only the highly related fragments of OOV terms can be found , rather than their correct translations . To evaluate the relevance of translation pair precisely , SVM and RankingSVM are employed as classifier and ordinal regression model respectively.
4.2 Feature Representation
The same feature set is utilized by SVM and
RankingSVM.
(1) Term frequency : fq denotes the frequency of OOV to be translated in all the Web snippets of search results . tfi indicates the number of the translation candidate in all the snippets.
dfi represents the number of Web snippets that contains the candidate . dft means the number of snippets that contains both OOV to be translated and the candidate.
(2) Term length : Len ( ) is the length of the candidate.
(3) Cooccurrence Distance : C-Dist is the average distance between the OOV query and the translation candidate , computed as follows.
( ) - t
Sum Dist
C Dist df = (1) where Sum(Dist ) is the sum of distance in each translation pair of every snippet.
(4) Length Ratio : This is the ratio of OOV query length and translation candidate length.
(5) Rank Value : i . Top Rank ( T-Rank ): The rank of snippet that first contains the candidate . This value indicates the rank given by search engine.
ii . Average_Rank ( A-Rank ): It is the average position of candidate in snippets of search results , shown as follows . ( ) idf
RankSum
RankA =? (2) where Sum(Rank ) denotes the sum of every single rank value of snippets that contains the candidate.
iii . Simple_Rank ( S-Rank ): It is computed based on Rank(i)=tfi*Len(i ), which aims at investigating the impact of these two features on ranking translation.
iv . R-Rank : This rank method is utilized as a comparison basis , computed as follows.
( )
OOV nn f f
L
S
RankR ??+?=? ?? 1 (3) where ? is set as 0.25 empirically , | Sn | represents the length of candidate term , L is the largest length of candidate terms , fn is tfi , and foov is fq in Feature (1).
v . Df_Rank ( D-Rank ): It is similar to S-
Rank and computed based on Rank(i )= dfi * Len(i).
(6) Mark feature : Within a certain distance ( usually less than 10 characters ) between the original OOV and candidate , if there is such a term like ????, ?????, ??????, ??????, ??????, ?????, ??? ??, ?????, ??????, this feature will be labeled as ?+1?, else ?-1? instead.
Among these features above , some features come from search engine like (1) and (5) and some ones from heuristic rules like (3) and (6).
Through the establishment of feature set , the translation candidate can be optimized efficiently and the noisy information can also be filtered.
5 Experiment and Analysis 5.1 Data Set
For the performance evaluation of ChineseEnglish OOV translation , the corpus of NER task in SIGHAN 2008 provided by Peking University is used . The whole corpus contains 19,866 person names , 22,212 location names and 7,837 organization names , from which 100 person names , 100 location names and 100 organization names are selected for testing . Meanwhile , 300 English named entities are chosen randomly from the terms of 9 categories , which include movie name , book title , organization name , brand name , terminology , idiom , rare animal name , person name ing data for EnglishChinese OOV translation.
5.2 Evaluation Metrics
Three parameters are used for the evaluation of translation and ranking candidates.

The first one is a measurement for translation and the others are used for ranking measurement.
5.3 Experiment on Parameter Setting
Frequency and length are two crucial features for translation candidates . To get the most related terms into top 10 before the final ranking , a pre-rank testing is performed based on S-Rank , R-Rank and D-Rank . It can be seen from Figure 2 that the pre-rank by D-Rank exhibits better performance in translation experiment.

Figure 2. The impact of different Pre-Rank manners on EnglishChinese OOV translation.
In search results , for some English OOV terms such as ? BYOB (????)?, there are few candidates with better quality in top 20 snippets.
Therefore , in order to find how many snippets are suitable in translation , the experiment on snippet number is performed . It can be observed from Figure 3 that the best performance can be obtained by utilizing 200 snippets.

It can be observed from Table 2 that the performance of Chinese location name translation is much higher than the other two categories . This is because most of the location names are famous cities or countries . The experimental results above demonstrate that the proposed model can be applicable in all kinds of OOV terms.

From the experiments above , it can be concluded that the supervised learning significantly outperform the conventional ranking strategies.
5.6 Analysis and Discussion
Through analysis about the experimental results in extraction and ranking , it can be observed that the OOV translation quality is highly related to the following aspects.
(1) The translation results are related to the search engine used , especially for some specific OOV terms . For example , given a query
OOV term ??????, the mining result based on Google in China is ? three direct links ?, while some meaningless information is mined by the other engines like Live Trans.
(2) Some terms are conventional terminologies and cannot be translated literally . For example , ? woman pace-setter ?, a proper name with the particular Chinese characteristic , should be translated into ???????, rather than ??????? or ????.
(3) The proposed model is sensitive to the notability degree of OOV term . For famous person name and book title , the translation performance is very promising . However , for other OOV terms with lower notability , such as ?????? and ?????, the correct translation cannot even be retrieved by search engine.
(4) Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) should be added to improve the whole translation performance . Although most of OOVs have unique semantic definition , there are still a few OOVs with ambiguity . For example , ? Rice ? can either be a person name or a kind of food . Another example is ? AARP ?, which also has two kinds of meaning , that is , ??? ?????? and ????????.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper , the proposed model improves the acquirement ability for OOV translation through Web mining and solves the translation pair evaluation problem in a novel way by introducing supervised learning in translation ranking . In addition , it is very significant to apply the key techniques in traditional machine translation into OOV translation , such as OOV recognition , statistical machine learning , alignment of sentence and phoneme , and WSD . The merits of these techniques should be integrated . All these aspects above will become the research focus in our future work.
