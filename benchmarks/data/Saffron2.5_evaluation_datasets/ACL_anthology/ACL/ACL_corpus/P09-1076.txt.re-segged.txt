Abstract
Articles in the Penn TreeBank were identified as being reviews , summaries , letters to the editor , news reportage , corrections , wit and short verse , or quarterly profit reports . All but the latter three were then characterised in terms of features manually annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank ? discourse connectives and their senses . Summaries turned out to display very different discourse features than the other three genres . Letters also appeared to have some different features.
The two main findings involve (1) differences between genres in the senses associated with intrasentential discourse connectives , intersentential discourse connectives and intersentential discourse relations that are not lexically marked ; and (2) differences within all four genres between the senses of discourse relations not lexically marked and those that are marked . The first finding means that genre should be made a factor in automated sense labelling of non-lexically marked discourse relations . The second means that lexically marked relations provide a poor model for automated sense labelling of relations that are not lexically marked.
1 Introduction
It is wellknown that texts differ from each other in a variety of ways , including their topic , the reading level of their intended audience , and their intended purpose ( eg , to instruct , to inform , to express an opinion , to summarize , to take issue with or disagree , to correct , to entertain , etc .). This paper considers differences in texts in the wellknown Penn TreeBank ( hereafter , PTB ) and in particular , how these differences show up in the Penn Discourse TreeBank ( Prasad et al , 2008).
It first describes ways in which texts can vary ( Section 2). It then illustrates the variety of texts to be found in the the PTB and suggests their grouping into four broad genres ( Section 3). After a brief introduction to the Penn Discourse TreeBank ( hereafter , PDTB ) in Section 4, Sections 5 and 6 show that these four genres display differences in connective frequency and in terms of the senses associated with intrasentential connectives ( eg , subordinating conjunctions ), intersentential connectives ( eg , intersentential coordinating conjunctions ) and those intersentential relations that are not lexically marked . Section 7 considers recent efforts to induce effective procedures for automated sense labelling of discourse relations that are not lexically marked ( Elwell and Baldridge , 2008; Marcu and Echihabi , 2002; Pitler et al , 2009; Wellner and Pustejovsky , 2007; Wellner , 2008). It makes two points . First , because genres differ from each other in the senses associated with such relations , genre should be made a factor in their automated sense labelling . Secondly , because different senses are being conveyed when a relation is lexically marked than when it isn?t , lexically marked relations provide a poor model for automated sense labelling of relations that are not lexically marked.
2 Two Perspectives on Genre
The dimension of text variation of interest here is genre , which can be viewed externally , in terms of the communicative purpose of a text ( Swales , 1990), or internally , in terms of features common to texts sharing a communicative purpose.
(Kessler et al , 1997) combine these views by saying that a genre should not be so broad that the texts belonging to it don?t share any distinguishing properties ? . . . we would probably not use the term ? genre ? to describe merely the class of ing someone to do something , since that class ? which would include editorials , sermons , prayers , advertisements , and so forth ? has no distinguishing formal properties ( Kessler et al , 1997, p . 33).
A balanced corpus like the Brown Corpus of American English or the British National Corpus , will sample texts from different genres , to give a representative view of how the language is used.
For example , the fifteen categories of published material sampled for the Brown Corpus include PRESS REPORTAGE , PRESS EDITORIALS , PRESS REVIEWS and five different types of FICTION.
In contrast , experiments on what genres would be helpful in web search for particular types of information on a topic led ( Rosso , 2008), to 18 class labels that his subjects could reliably apply to web pages ( here , ones from an . edu domain ) with over 50% agreement . These class labels included ARTICLE , COURSE DESCRIPTION , COURSE LIST , DI-ARY , WEBLOG OR BLOG , FAQ/HELP and FORM.
In both Brown?s published material and Rosso?s web pages , the selected class labels ( genres ) reflect external purpose rather than distinctive internal features.
Such features are , however , of great interest in both text analysis and text processing . Text analysts have shown that there are indeed interesting features that correlate more strongly with certain genres than with others . For example , ( Biber , 1986) considered 41 linguistic features previously mentioned in the literature , including type/token ratio , average word length , and such frequencies as that of particular words ( eg , I/you , it , the proverb do ), particular word types ( eg , place adverbs , hedges ), particular parts-of-speech ( eg , past tense verbs , adjectives ), and particular syntactic constructions ( eg , that-clauses , if - clauses , reduced relative clauses ). He found certain clusters of these features ( i.e . their presense or absense ) correlated well with certain text types . For example , press reportage scored the highest with respect to high frequency of that-clauses and contractions , and low type-token ratio ( i.e . a varied vocabulary for a given length of text ), while general and romantic fiction scored much lower on these features . ( Biber , 2003) showed significant differences in the internal structure of noun phrases used in fiction , news , academic writing and face-to-face conversations.
Such features are of similar interest in text processing ? in particular , automated genre classification ( Dewdney et al , 2001; Finn and Kushmerick , 2006; Kessler et al , 1997; Stamatatos et al , 2000; Wolters and Kirsten , 1999) ? which relies on there being reliably detectable features that can be used to distinguish one class from another . This is where the caveat from ( Kessler et al , 1997) becomes relevant : A particular genre shouldn?t be taken so broadly as to have no distinguishing features , nor so narrowly as to have no general applicability . But this still allows variability in what is taken to be a genre . There is no one ? right set?.
3 Genre in the Penn TreeBank
Although the files in the Penn TreeBank ( PTB ) lack any classificatory metadata , leading the PTB to be treated as a single homogeneous collection of ? news articles ?, researchers who have manually examined it in detail have noted that it includes a variety of ? financial reports , general interest stories , business-related news , cultural reviews , editorials and letters to the editor ? ( Carlson et al , 2002, p . 7).
To date , ignoring this variety hasn?t really mattered since the PTB has primarily been used in developing word-level and sentence-level tools for automated language analysis such as wide-coverage part-of-speech taggers , robust parsers and statistical sentence generators . Any genre-related differences in word usage and/or syntax have just meant a wider variety of words and sentences shaping the covereage of these tools . However , ignoring this variety may actually hinder the development of robust language technology for analysing and/or generating multi-sentence text.
As such , it is worth considering genre in the PTB , since doing so can allow texts from different genres to be weighted differently when tools are being developed.
This is a start on such an undertaking . In lieu of any informative metadata in the PTB files1, I looked at line-level patterns in the 2159 files that make up the Penn Discourse TreeBank subset of the PTB , and then manually confirmed the text types I found.2 The resulting set includes all the 1Subsequent to this paper , I discovered that the TIPSTER Collection ( LDC Catalog entry LDC93T3B ) contains a small amount of metadata that can be projected onto the PTB files , to refine the semiautomatic , manually-verified analysis done here . This work is now in progress.
2Similar patterns can also be found among the 153 files in well : 1. Op-Ed pieces and reviews ending with a byline (73 files ): wsj 0071, wsj 0087, wsj 0108, wsj 0186, wsj 0207, wsj 0239, wsj 0257, etc.
2. Sourced articles from another newspaper or magazine (8 files ): wsj 1453, wsj 1569, wsj 1623, wsj 1635, wsj 1809, wsj 1970, wsj 2017, wsj 2153 3. Editorials and other reviews , similar to the above , but lacking a byline or source (11 files ): wsj 0039, wsj 0456, wsj 0765, wsj 0794, wsj 0819, wsj 0972, wsj 1259 wsj 1315, etc.
4. Essays on topics commemorating the WSJ?s centennial (12 files ): wsj 0022, wsj 0339, wsj 0406, wsj 0676, wsj 0933, 2sj 1164, etc.
5. Daily summaries of offerings and pricings in U.S . and non-U.S . capital markets (13 files ): wsj 0125, wsj 0271, wsj 0476, wsj 0612, wsj 0704, wsj 1001, wsj 1161, wsj 1312, wsj 1441, etc.
6. Daily summaries of financially significant events , ending with a summary of the day?s market figures (14 files ): wsj 0178, wsj 0350, wsj 0493, wsj 0675, wsj 1043, wsj 1217, etc.
7. Daily summaries of interest rates (12 files ): wsj 0219, wsj 0457, wsj 0602, wsj 0986, etc.
8. Summaries of recent SEC filings (4 files ): wsj 0599, wsj 0770, wsj 1156, wsj 1247 9. Weekly market summaries (12 files ): wsj 0137, wsj 0231, wsj 0374, wsj 0586, wsj 1015, wsj 1187, wsj 1337, wsj 1505, wsj 1723, etc.
10. Letters to the editor (49 files3): wsj 0091, wsj 0094, wsj 0095, wsj 0266, wsj 0268, wsj 0360, wsj 0411, wsj 0433, wsj 0508, wsj 0687, etc.
11. Corrections (24 files ): wsj 0104, wsj 0200, wsj 0211, wsj 0410, wsj 0603, wsj 0605, etc.
12. Wit and short verse (14 files ): wsj 0139, wsj 0312, wsj 0594, wsj 0403, wsj 0757, etc.
13. Quarterly profit reports ? introductory paragraphs alone (11 files ): wsj 0190, wsj 0364, wsj 0511, wsj 0696, wsj 1056, wsj 1228, etc.
the Penn TreeBank that aren?t included in the PDTB . However , such files were excluded so that all further analyses could be carried out on the same set of files.
3The relation between letters and files is not one-to-one : 13 (26.5%) of these files contain between two and six letters.
This is relevant at the end of this section when considering length as a potentially distinguishing feature of a text.
14. News reports (1902 files)
A complete listing of these classes can be found in an electronic appendix to this article at the PDTB home page ( http://www.seas.upenn.edu/?pdtb).
In order to consider discourse-level features distinctive to genres within the PTB , I have ignored , for the time being , both CORRECTIONS and WIT AND SHORT VERSE since they are so obviously different from the other texts , and also QUAR-TERLY PROFIT REPORTS , since they turn out to be multiple simply copies of the same text because the distinguishing company listings have been omitted.
The remaining eleven classes have been aggregated into four broad genres : ESSAYS (104 files , classes 14), SUMMARIES (55 files , classes 59), LETTERS (49 files , class 10) and NEWS (1902 files , class 14). The latter corresponds to the Brown Corpus class PRESS RE-
PORTAGE and the class NEWS in the New
York Times annotated corpus ( Evan Sandhaus , 2008), excluding CORRECTIONS and OBITUARIES . The LETTERS class here corresponds to the NYT class OPINION/LETTERS , while ESSAYS here spans both Brown Corpus classes PRESS REVIEWS and PRESS EDITORIALS , and the NYT corpus classes OPINION/EDITORIALS,
OPINION/OPED , FEATURES/XXX/COLUMNS and
FEATURES/XXX/REVIEWS , where XXX ranges over Arts , Books , Dining and Wine , Movies , Style , etc . The class called SUMMARIES has no corresponding class in Brown . In the NYT Corpus , it corresponds to those articles whose taxonomic classifiers field is NEWS/BUSINESS and whose types of material field is SCHEDULE.
There are two things to note here . First , no claim is being made that these are the only classes to be found in the PTB . For example , the class labelled NEWS contains a subset of 80 short (13 sentence ) articles announcing personnel changes ? eg , promotions , appointments to supervisory boards , etc . ( eg , wsj 0001, wsj 0014, wsj 0066, wsj 0069, wsj 0218, etc .) I have not looked for more specific classes because even classes at this level of specificity show that ignoring genre-specific discourse features can hinder the development of robust language technology for either analysing or generating multi-sentence text . Secondly , no claim is being made that the four selected classes comprise the ? right ? set of genres for future use of the PTB for discourse-related genre will lead to better performance.
Some simple differences between the four broad genre can be seen in Figure 1, in terms of the average length of a file in words , sentences or para-graphs4, and the average number of sentences per paragraph . Figure 1 shows that essays are , on average , longer than texts from the other three classes , and have longer paragraphs . The relevance of the latter will become clear in the next section , when I describe PDTB annotation as background for genre differences related to this annotation.
4 The Penn Discourse TreeBank
Genre differences at the level of discourse in the PTB can be seen in the manual annotations of the Penn Discourse TreeBank ( Prasad et al , 2008).
There are several elements to PDTB annotation.
First , the PDTB annotates the arguments of explicit discourse connectives : (1) Even so , according to Mr . Salmore , the ad was ? devastating ? because it raised questions about Mr . Courter?s credibility . But it?s building on a long tradition . (0041) Here , the explicit connective (? but ?) is underlined.
Its first argument , ARG1, is shown in italics and its second , ARG2, in boldface . The number 0041 indicates that the example comes from subsection wsj 0041 of the PTB.
Secondly , the PDTB annotates implicit discourse relations between adjacent sentences within the same paragraph , where the second does not contain an explicit intersentential connective : (2) The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas?s supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500. [ Implicit ? so ?] By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room , Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs . (0994) With implicit discourse relations , annotators were asked to identify one or more explicit connectives that could be inserted to lexicalize the relation between the arguments . Here , they have been identified as the connective ? so?.
Where annotators could not identify such an implicit connective , they were asked if they could identify a nonconnective phrase in ARG2 ( e.g.
4A file usually contains a single article , except ( as noted earlier ) files in the class LETTERS , which may contain more than one letter.
?this means ?) that realised the implicit discourse relation instead ( ALTLEX ), or a relation holding between the second sentence and an entity mentioned in the first ( ENTREL ), rather than the interpretation of the previous sentence itself : (3) Rated triple-A by Moody?s and S&P , the issue will be sold through First Boston Corp . The issue is backed by a 12% letter of credit from Credit Suisse.
If the annotators couldn?t identify either , they would assert that no discourse relation held between the adjacent sentences ( NOREL ). Note that because resource limitations meant that implicit discourse relations ( comprising implicit connectives , ALTLEX , ENTREL and NOREL ) were only annotated within paragraphs , longer paragraphs ( as there were in ESSAYS ) could potentially mean more implicit discourse relations were annotated.
The third element of PDTB annotation is that of the senses of connectives , both explicit and implicit . These have been manually annotated using the three-level sense hierarchy described in detail in ( Miltsakaki et al , 2008). Briefly , there are four toplevel classes : ? TEMPORAL , where the situations described in the arguments are related temporally ; ? CONTINGENCY , where the situation described in one argument causally influences that described in the other ; ? COMPARISON , used to highlight some prominent difference that holds between the situations described in the two arguments ; ? EXPANSION , where one argument expands the situation described in the other and moves the narrative or exposition forward.
TEMPORAL relations can be further specified to
ASYNCHRONOUS and SYNCHRONOUS , depending on whether or not the situations described by the arguments are temporally ordered . CONTINGENCY can be further specified to CAUSE and CONDITION , depending on whether or not the existential status of the arguments depends on the connective ( i.e . no for CAUSE , and yes for CON-
DITION).
COMPARISON can be further specified to CONTRAST , where the two arguments share a predicate or property whose difference is being highlighted , and CONCESSION , where ? the highlighted differences are related to expectations raised by one Genre files paragraphs sentences words per file per file per file per ? ESSAYS 104 1580 4774 98376 945.92 45.9 15.2 3.02 SUMMARIES 55 1047 2118 37604 683.71 38.5 19.1 2.02 LETTERS 49 339 739 15613 318.63 15.1 7.1 2.14 NEWS 1902 18437 40095 837367 440.26 21.1 9.7 2.17 Figure 1: Distribution of Words , Sentences and Paragraphs by Genre (? stands for ? paragraph ?.) argument which are then denied by the other ? ( Miltsakaki et al , 2008, p.282). Finally , EXPANSION has six subtypese , including CONJUNCTION , where the situation described in ARG2, provides new information related to the situation described in ARG1; RESTATEMENT , where ARG2 restates or redescribes the situation described in ARG1; and ALTERNATIVE , where the two arguments evoke situations taken to be alternatives.
These two levels are sufficient to show significant differences between genres . The only other thing to note is that annotators could be as specific as they chose in annotating the sense of a connective : If they could not decide on the specific type of COMPARISON holding between the two arguments of a connective , or they felt that both subtypes of COMPARISON were being expressed , they could simply sense annotate the connective with the label COMPARISON . I will comment on this in
Section 6.
The fourth element of PDTB annotation is attribution ( Prasad et al , 2007; Prasad et al , 2008).
This was not considered in the current analysis , although here too , genre-related differences are likely.
5 Connective Frequency by Genre
The analysis that follows distinguishes between two kinds of relations associated with explicit connectives in the PDTB : (1) intrasentential discourse relations , which hold between clauses within the same sentence and are associated with subordinating conjunctions , intrasentential coordinating conjunctions , and discourse adverbials whose arguments occur within the same sen-tence5); and (2) explicit intersentential discourse relations , which hold across sentences and are associated with explicit intersentential connectives ( intersentential coordinating conjunctions and discourse adverbials whose arguments are not 5Limited resources meant that intrasentential discourse relations associated with subordinators like ? in order to ? and ? so that ? or with free adjuncts were not annotated in the
PDTB.
in the same sentence).
It is the latter that are effectively in complementary distribution with implicit discourse relations in the PDTB6, and Figures 2 and 3 show their distribution across the four genres.7 Figure 2 shows that among explicit intersentential connectives , Sinitial coordinating conjunctions (? And ?, ? Or ? and ? But ?) are a feature of ESSAYS , SUMMARIES and NEWS but not of LETTERS . LETTERS are written by members of the public , not by the journalists or editors working for the Wall Street Journal.
This suggests that the use of Sinitial coordinating conjunctions is an element of Wall Street Journal ? house style ?, as opposed to a common feature of modern writing.
Figure 3 shows several things about the different patterning across genres of implicit discourse relations ( Columns 4?7 for implicit connectives , ALTLEX , ENTREL and NOREL ) and explicit intersentential connectives ( Column 3).
First , SUMMARIES are distinctive in two ways : While the ratio of implicit connectives to explicit intersentential connectives is around 3:1 in the other three genres , for SUMMARIES it is around 4:1 ? there are just many fewer explicit intersentential connectives . Secondly , while the ratio of ENTREL relations to implicit connectives ranges from 0.19 to 0.32 in the other three genres , in SUMMARIES , ENTREL predominates ( as in Example 3 from one of the daily summaries of offerings and pricings ). In fact , there are nearly as 6This is not quite true for two reasons ? first , because the first argument of a discourse adverbial is not restricted to the immediately adjacent sentence and secondly , because a sentence can have both an initial coordinating conjunction and a discourse adverbial , as in ? So , for example , he?ll eat tofu with fried pork rinds .? But it?s a reasonable first approximation.
7Although annotated in the PDTB , throughout this paper I have ignored the S-medial discourse adverbial also , as in ? John also eats fish ?, since such instances are better regarded as presuppositional . That is , as well as a textual antecedent , they can be licensed through inference ( e.g . ? John claims to be a vegetarian , but he also eats fish .?) or accommodated by listeners with respect to the spatiotemporal context ( e.g.
Watching John dig into a bowl of tofu , one might remark ? Don?t worry . He also eats fish .?) The other discourse adverbials annotated in the PDTB do not have this property.

many ENTREL relations in summaries as the total of explicit and implicit connectives combined.
Finally , it is possible that the higher frequency of alternative lexicalizations of discourse connectives ( ALTLEX ) in LETTERS than in the other three genres means that they are not part of Wall Street Journal ? house style ?. ( Other elements of WSJ ? house style ? ? or possibly , news style in general ? are observable in the significantly higher frequency of direct and indirect quotations in news than in the other three genres . This property is not discussed further here , but is worth investigating in the future .) With respect to explicit intrasentential connectives , the main point of interest in Figure 4 is that SUMMARIES display a significantly lower density of intrasentential connectives overall than the other three genres , as well as a significantly lower relative frequency of intrasentential discourse adverbials . As the next section will show , these intrasentential connectives , while few , are selected most often to express CONTRAST and situations changing over time , reflecting the nature of SUMMARIES as regular periodic summaries of a changing world.
6 Connective Sense by Genre ( Pitler et al , 2008) show a difference across Level 1 senses ( COMPARISON , CONTINGENCY , TEMPORAL and EXPANSION ) in the PDTB in terms of their tendency to be realised by explicit connectives ( a tendency of COMPARISON and TEMPORAL relations ) or by Implicit Connectives ( a tendency of CONTINGENCY and EXPANSION ). Here I show differences ( focussing on Level 2 senses , which are more informative ) in their frequency of occurance in the four genres , by type of connective : explicit intrasentential connectives ( Figure 5), explicit intersentential connectives ( Figure 6), and implicit intersentential connectives ( Figure 7). SUMMARIES and LETTERS are each distinctly different from ESSAYS and NEWS with respect to each type of connective.
One difference in sense annotation across the four genres harkens back to a comment made in Section 4 ? that annotators could be as specific as they chose in annotating the sense of a connective . If they could not decide between specific level n+1 labels for the sense of a connective , they could simply assign it a level n label . It is perhaps suggestive then of the relative complexity of ESSAYS and LETTERS , as compared to NEWS , that the toplevel label COMPARISON was used approximately twice as often in labelling explicit intersentential connectives in ESSAYS (7.2%) and LETTERS (9.4%) than in news (4.3%). ( The toplevel labels EXPANSION , TEMPORAL and CONTINGENCY were used far less often , as to be simply noise .) In any case , this aspect of readability may be worth further investigation ( Pitler and
Nenkova , 2008).

Figure 9: Letters and News : Connective sense frequency 2008). There are two points to make . First , Figure 7 provides evidence ( in terms of differences between genres in the senses associated with intersentential discourse relations that are not lexically marked ) for taking genre as a factor in automated sense labelling of those relations.
Secondly , Figures 8 and 9 summarize Figures 5, 6 and 7 with respect to the five senses that occur most frequently in the four genre with discourse relations that are not lexically marked , covering between 84% and 91% of those relations . These Figures show that , no matter what genre one considers , different senses tend to be expressed with ( explicit ) intrasentential connectives , with explicit intersentential connectives and with implicit connectives . This means that lexically marked relations provide a poor model for automated sense labelling of relations that are not lexically marked . This is new evidence for the suggestion ( Sporleder and Lascarides , 2008) that intrinsic differences between explicit and implicit discourse relations mean that the latter have to be learned independently of the former.
8 Conclusion
This paper has , for the first time , provided genre information about the articles in the Penn TreeBank . It has characterised each genre in terms of features manually annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank , and used this to show that genre should be made a factor in automated sense labelling of discourse relations that are not explicitly marked.
There are clearly other potential differences that one might usefully investigate : For example , following ( Pitler et al , 2008), one might look at whether connectives with multiple senses occur with only one of those senses ( or mainly so ) in a particular genre . Or one might investigate how patterns of attribution vary in different genres , since this is relevant to subjectivity in text . Other aspects of genre may be even more significant for language technology . For example , whereas the first sentence of a news article might be an effective summary of its contents ? e.g.
(4) Singer Bette Midler won a $400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using ? sound-alike ? performers to tout products . ( wsj 0485) it might be less so in the case of an essay , even one of about the same length ? e.g.
(5) On June 30, a major part of our trade deficit went poof ! ( wsj 0447) Of course , to exploit these differences , it is important to be able to automatically identify what genre or genres a text belongs to . Fortunately , there is a growing body of work on genre-based text classification , including ( Dewdney et al , 2001; Finn and Kushmerick , 2006; Kessler et al , 1997; Stamatatos et al , 2000; Wolters and Kirsten , 1999). Of particular interest in this regard is whether other news corpora , such as the New York Times Annotated Corpus ( Linguistics Data Consortium Catalog Number : LDC2008T19) manifest similar properties to theWSJ in their different genres . If so , then genre-specific extrapolation from the WSJ Corpus may enable better performance on a wider range of corpora.
