Abstract
Combining word alignments trained in two translation directions has mostly relied on heuristics that are not directly motivated by intended applications . We propose a novel method that performs combination as an optimization process.
Our algorithm explicitly maximizes the effectiveness function with greedy search for phrase table training or synchronized grammar extraction . Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to significantly better translation quality than existing methods . Analysis suggests that this simple approach is able to maintain accuracy while maximizing coverage.
1 Introduction
Word alignment is the process of identifying word-to-word links between parallel sentences . It is a fundamental and often a necessary step before linguistic knowledge acquisitions , such as training a phrase translation table in phrasal machine translation ( MT ) system ( Koehn et al , 2003), or extracting hierarchial phrase rules or synchronized grammars in syntaxbased translation framework.
Most word alignment models distinguish translation direction in deriving word alignment matrix.
Given a parallel sentence , word alignments in two directions are established first , and then they are combined as knowledge source for phrase training or rule extraction . This process is also called symmetrization . It is a common practice in most state of the art MT systems . Widely used alignment models , such as IBM Model serial ( Brown et al , 1993) and HMM , all assume one-to-many alignments . Since many-to-many links are commonly observed in natural language , symmetrization is able to make up for this modeling limitation . On the other hand , combining two directional alignments practically can lead to improved performance . Symmetrization can also be realized during alignment model training ( Liang et al , 2006; Zens et al , 2004).
Given two sets of word alignments trained in two translation directions , two extreme combination are intersection and union . While intersection achieves high precision with low recall , union is the opposite . A right balance of these two extreme cases would offer a good coverage with reasonable accuracy . So starting from intersection , gradually adding elements in the union by heuristics is typically used . Koehn et al (2003) grow the set of word links by appending neighboring points , while Och and Hey (2003) try to avoid both horizontal and vertical neighbors . These heuristic-based combination methods are not driven explicitly by the intended application of the resulting output . Ayan (2005) exploits many advanced machine learning techniques for general word alignment combination problem . However , human annotation is required for supervised training in those techniques.
We propose a new combination method . Like heuristics , we aim to find a balance between intersection and union . But unlike heuristics , combination is carried out as an optimization process driven by an effectiveness function . We evaluate the impact of each alignment pair w.r.t . the target application , say phrase table training , and gradually add or remove the word link that currently can maximize the predicted benefit measured by the effectiveness function . More specifically , we consider the goal of word alignment combination is for phrase table training , and we directly motivate word alignment combination as a process of maximizing the number of phrase translations that can be extracted within a sentence pair.
2 Combination As Optimization Process
Given a parallel sentence ( e = e
I
J word link is represented by a pair of indices ( i , j ), j is aligned with
English word e i . The direction of word alignments is ignored . Since the goal of word alignment combination is for phrase table training , we first formally define a phrase translation . Provided with a set of static word alignments A , a phrase pair ( e i j and only if there exists at least one word link between them and no cross phrase boundary links exist in A , i.e ., for all ( i , j ) ? A , i ? [ i [ j matter whether boundary words of the phrase pairs should be aligned or not . Let PP n ( A ) denote the set of phrase pairs that can be extracted with A where up to n boundary words are allowed to be not-aligned , i.e ., aligned to empty word NULL . As can be imagined , increasing n would improve recall of phrase table but likely to hurt precision . For word alignment combination , we focus on the set with high accuracy where n = 0.
Let A to be combined for the given sentence pair . For instance , A glish to foreign while A different setup , A while A method we presented in Algorithm 1, we start with intersection A
I . A c is the candidate link set to be evaluated and appended to the combined set A . Its initial value is the difference between union and intersection . We assume that there is an effectiveness function g (?) which quantitatively measures the ? goodness ? of a alignment set for the intended application . A higher number indicates a better alignment set . We use the function g to drive the process . Each time , we identify the best word link ( ? i , ? j ) in the candidate set that can maximize the function g and append it to the current set A . This process is repeated until the candidate set is empty or adding any link in the set would lead to degradation . Finally ( line 15 to 21), we pickup word links in the candidate set to align those uncovered words . This is applied to maximize coverage , which is similar as the ? final ? in ( Koehn et al , 2003). Again , we use the function g (?) to rank the word links in A c and sequentially append them to
A depending on current word coverage.
The algorithm clearly is a greedy search procedure that maximizes the function g . Since we plan to take the combined word alignments for phrase translation training , a natural choice for g is the number of phrase pairs that can be extracted with the given alignment set . We choose g(A ) = | PP pairs that all boundary words are aligned . The reason of putting a tight constraint is to maintain phrase table accuracy while improving the coverage . By keeping track of the span of currently aligned words , we can have efficient implementation of the function g.

We start with the union A = A
U , and gradually remove the worse word link ( ? i , ? j ) = argmax ( i,j)?A c g(A ? {( i , j )}) that could maximize the effectiveness function . Similarly , this shrinking process is repeated until either candidate set is empty or removing any link in the candidate set would reduce the value of function g.
Other choice of ? goodness ? function g is possible . For instance , one could consider syntactic constraints , or weight phrase pairs differently according to their global cooccurrence . The basic idea is to implement the combination as an iterative customized optimization process that is driven by the application.
3 Experimental Results
We test the proposed new idea on Persian Farsi to English translation . The task is to translate spoken Farsi into English . We decode reference transcription so recognition is not an issue . The training gram . It consists of around 110K sentence pairs with 850K English words in the military force protection domain . We train IBM Model4 using GIZA ++ toolkit ( Och and Ney , 2003) in two translation directions and perform different word alignment combination . The resulting alignment set is used to train a phrase translation table , where Farsi phrases are limited to up to 6 words.
The quality of resulting phrase translation table is measured by translation results . Our decoder is a phrasebased multi-stack implementation of the loglinear model similar to Pharaoh ( Koehn et al ., 2003). Like other loglinear model based decoders , active features in our translation engine include translation models in two directions , lexicon weights in two directions , language model , lexicalized reordering models , sentence length penalty and other heuristics . These feature weights are tuned on the dev set to achieve optimal translation performance evaluated by automatic metric.
The language model is a statistical 4gram model estimated with Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing ( Chen and Goodman , 1996) using only English sentences in the parallel training data.
3.1 Phrase Table Comparison
We first study the impact of different word alignment combination methods on phrase translation table , and compare our approaches to heuristic based methods . The same English to Farsi and Farsi to English Model4 word alignments are used , but we try different combination methods and analysis the final alignment set and the resulting phase translation table . Table 1 presents some statistics . Each row corresponds to a particular combination . The first two are intersection ( I ) and union ( U ). The next two methods are heuristic ( H ) in ( Och and Ney , 2003) and grow-diagonal ( GD ) proposed in ( Koehn et al , 2003). Our proposed methods are presented in the following two rows : one is optimization as an expanding process ( OE ), the other is optimization as an shrinking process ( OS ). In the last four rows , we add ? final ? operation ( line 15 to 21 in Algorithm 1).
For each method , we calculate the output alignment set size as a percentage of the union ( the 2nd column ) and resulting phrase table ( PP n ( A )) size ( in thousand ) with different constrain on the maximum number of unaligned boundary words n = 0, 1, 2 ( the next 3 columns ). As we can see , the intersection has less than half of all word links in the pool . This implies the underlying word alignment quality leaves much room for improvements , mainly due to data sparseness . Not surprisingly , when relaxing unaligned boundary word number from 0 to 2, the phrase table size increases more than 7 times . This is the result of very low recall of word alignments , consequently the estimated phrase table PP racy . Union suffers from the opposite problem : many incorrect word links prevent good phrase pairs from being extracted.
The two heuristic methods and our proposed optimization approaches achieve somewhat a balance between I and U . By comparing size of
PP able to identify much more phrase pairs with similar size of alignment set . This confirms that the new method is indeed moving to the desired direction of extracting as many accurate ( all boundary words should be aligned ) phrase pairs as possible . We still notice that ratio of | PP | PP that the ratio of this two phrase table size might somewhat be indicative of the phrase table accuracy , which is hard to estimate without manual annotation though.

Table 1: Statistics of word alignment set and the resulting phrase table size ( number of entries in thousand ( K )) with different combination methods 3.2 Translation Results The ultimate goal of word alignment combination is for building translation system . The quality of resulting phrase tables is measured by automatic translation metric . We have one dev set (1430 sentences with 11483 running words ), test set 1 (1390 sentences with 10334 running words ) and test set 2 (417 sentences with 4239 running words ). The dev set and test set 1 are part of all available Farsi-training data as tuning and testing . The test set 2 is the standard NIST offline evaluation set , where 4 references are available for each sentence . The dev and test set 1 are much closer to the training set than the standard test set 2. We tune all feature weights automatically ( Och , 2003) to maximize the BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2002) score on the dev set.
Table 2 shows BLEU score of different combination methods on all three sets . Union performs much worse on the dev and test1 than intersection , while intersection achieved the same performance on test2 as union but with more than 6 times of phrase table size . Grow-diagonal ( GD ) has more than 1 bleu point on test2 than intersection but with less than half of phrase table size.
The proposed new method OE is consistently better than both heuristic methods GD and H , with more than 1 point on dev/teset1 and 0.7 point on test2. Comparing the last group to the middle one , we can see the effect of the ? final ? operation on all four methods . Tabel 1 shows that after applying the final operation , phrase table size is cut into half . When evaluated with automatic translation metric , all four methods generally perform much worse on dev and test1 that are close to training data , but better on NIST standard test2. We observe half BLEU point improvement for optimization method but marginal gain for heuristic-based approaches . This suggest that the phrase table accuracy get improved with the final operation . Optimization method directly tries to maximize the number of phrase pairs that can be extracted . We observe that it ( OEF ) is able to find more than 14% more phrase pairs than heuristic methods and achieve 1 BLEU point gain than the best heuristic method ( GDF).

Table 2: Translation results ( BLEU score ) with phrase tables trained with different word alignment combination methods 4 Conclusions We presented a simple yet effective method for word alignment symmetrization and combination in general . The problem is formulated as an optimization with greedy search driven by an effectiveness function , which can be customized directly to maximum benefit for intended applications such as phrase table training or synchronized grammar extraction in machine translation . Experimental results demonstrated consistent better BLEU scores than the best heuristic method . The optimization process can better maintain accuracy while improving coverage.
The algorithm is generic and leaves much space for variations . For instance , designing a better effectiveness function g , or considering a soft link with some probability rather than binary 0/1 connection would potentially be opportunities for further improvement . On the other hand , the search space of current algorithm is limited by the pool of candidate set , it is possible to suggest new links while driven by the target function.
