Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive  . Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that cannot be reused  . 
We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick  , inexpensive , and language-independent , that correlates highly with human evaluation , and that has little marginal cost per run . We present this method as an automated under study to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations  . 11 Introduction 1 . 1 Rationale Human evaluations of machine translation  ( MT ) weigh many aspects of translation , including adequacy , fidelity , and fluency of the translation ( Hovy , 1999; White and O?Connell ,  1994) . A comprehensive catalog of MT evaluation techniques and their rich literature is given by Reeder  ( 2001 )  . For the most part , these various human evaluation approaches are quite expensive  ( Hovy ,  1999) . Moreover , they can take weeks or months to finish . This is a big problem because developers of machine translation systems need to monitor the effect of daily changes to their systems in order to weed out bad ideas from good ideas  . We believe that MT progress stems from evaluation and that there is a log jam of fruitful research ideas waiting to be released from  1So we call our method the bilingual evaluation under study  , 

the evaluation bottleneck . Developers would benefit from an inexpensive automatic evaluation that is quick  , language-independent , and correlates highly with human evaluation . We propose such an evaluation method in this paper  . 
1.2 Viewpoint
How does one measure translation performance ? The closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation  , the better it is . This is the central idea behind our proposal . To judge the quality of a machine translation , one measures its closeness to one or more reference human translations according to a numerical metric  . Thus , our MT evaluation system requires two ingredients  :   1  . a numerical ? translation closeness ? metric 2 . a corpus of good quality human reference translations We fashion our closeness metric after the highly successful word error rate metric used by the speech recognition community  , appropriately modified for multiple reference translations and allowing for legitimate differences in word choice and word order  . The main idea is to use a weighted average of variable length phrase matches against the reference translations  . This view gives rise to a family of metrics using various weighting schemes  . We have selected a promising baseline metric from this family  . 
In Section 2 , we describe the baseline metric in detail . In Section 3 , we evaluate the performance of BLEU . In Section 4 , we describe a human evaluation experiment . In Section 5 , we compare our baseline metric performance with human evaluations  .

Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for 2 The Baseline BLEU Metric Typically , there are many ? perfect ? translations of a given source sentence  . These translations may vary in word choice or in word order even when they use the same words  . And yet humans can clearly distinguish a good translation from a bad one  . For example , consider these two candidate translations of a Chinese source sentence : 
Example 1.
Candidate 1: It is a guide to action which ensures that the military always obeys the commands of the party  . 
Candidate 2: It is to insure the troops for ever hearing the activity guide book that party direct  . 
Although they appear to be on the same subject , they differ markedly in quality . For comparison , we provide three reference human translations of the same sentence below  . 
Reference 1: It is a guide to action that ensures that the military will for everheed Party commands  . 
Reference 2: It is the guiding principle which guarantees the military forces always being under the command of the 

Reference 3: It is the practical guide for the army always to heed the directions of the party  . 
It is clear that the good translation , Candidate 1 , shares many words and phrases with these three reference translations  , while Candidate 2 does not . We will shortly quantify this notion of sharing in Section  2  . 1 . But first observe that Candidate 1 shares " It is a guide to action " with Reference  1  , " which " with Reference 2 , " ensures that the military " with Reference 1 , " always " with References 2 and 3 , " commands " with Reference 1 , and finally " of the party " with Reference 2 ( all ignoring capitalization )  . In contrast , Candidate 2 exhibits far fewer matches , and their extent is less . 
It is clear that a program can rank Candidate 1 higher than Candidate 2 simply by comparing ngram matches between each candidate translation and the reference translations  . Experiments over large collections of translations presented in Section  5 show that this ranking ability is a general phenomenon  , and not an artifact of a few toy examples . 
The primary programming task for a BLEU imple -mentor is to compare ngrams of the candidate with the ngrams of the reference translation and count the number of matches  . These matches are position-independent . The more the matches , the better the candidate translation is . For simplicity , we first focus on computing unigram matches . 
2.1 Modified ngram precision
The corners tone of our metric is the familiar precision measure  . To compute precision , one simply counts up the number of candidate translation words  ( unigrams ) which occur in any reference translation and then divides by the total number of words in the candidate translation  . Unfortunately , MT systems can overgenerate ? reasonable ? words , resulting in improbable , but high precision , translations like that of example 2 below . Intuitively the problem is clear : a reference word should be considered exhausted after a matching candidate word is identified  . We formalize this intuition as the modified unigram precision  . To compute this , one first counts the maximum number of times a word occurs in any single reference translation  . Next , one clips the total count of each candidate word by its maximum reference count  , 2 adds these clipped counts up , and divides by the total ( unclipped ) number of candidate words . 
Example 2.
Candidate : the the the the the the.
Reference 1: The cat is on the mat.
Reference 2: There is a cat on the mat.
Modified Unigram Precision = 2/7.3
In Example 1 , Candidate 1 achieves a modified unigram precision of 17/18  ; whereas Candidate 2 achieves a modified unigram precision of 8/14  . 
Similarly , the modified unigram precision in Example 2 is 2/7  , even though its standard unigram precision is 7/7 . 
2 Count clip = min(Count,MaxRefCount) . In other words , one truncates each word?s count , if necessary , to not exceed the largest count observed in any single reference for that word  . 
3 As a guide to the eye , we have underlined the important words for computing modified precision  . 
Modified ngram precision is computed similarly for any n : all candidate ngram counts and their corresponding maximum reference counts are collected  . The candidate counts are clipped by their corresponding reference maximum value  , summed , and divided by the total number of candidate ngrams  . In Example 1 , Candidate 1 achieves a modified bigram precision of 10/17  , whereas the lower quality Candidate 2 achieves a modified bigram precision of 1/13  . In Example 2 , the ( implausible ) candidate achieves a modified bigram precision of  0  . 
This sort of modified ngram precision scoring captures two aspects of translation : adequacy and fluency  . A translation using the same words ( 1grams ) as in the references tends to satisfy adequacy . The longer ngram matches account for fluency .  4 2 . 1 . 1 Modified ngram precision on blocks of text How do we compute modified ngram precision on a multi -sentence test set ? Although one typically evaluates MT systems on a corpus of entire documents  , our basic unit of evaluation is the sentence . 
A source sentence may translate to many target sentences  , in which case we abuse terminology and refer to the corresponding target sentences as a ? sentence  . ? We first compute the ngram matches sentence by sentence  . Next , we add the clipped ngram counts for all the candidate sentences and divide by the number of candidate ngrams in the test corpus to compute a modified precision score  , pn , for the entire test corpus . 
pn = ?
C ? Candidates ? n-gram?C
Count clip(n-gram ) ?
C ? ? Candidates ? n-gram ? ? C ?
Count(n-gram?).
4BLEU only needs to match human judgment when averaged over a test corpus  ; scores on individual sentences will often vary from human judgments  . For example , a system which produces the fluent phrase ? East Asian economy ? is penalized heavily on the longer ngram precisions if all the references happen to read ? economy of East Asia  . ? The key to BLEU?s success is that all systems are treated similarly and multiple human translators with different styles are used  , so this effect cancels out in comparisons between systems  . 
2 . 1 . 2 Ranking systems using only modified ngram precision To verify that modified ngram precision distinguishes between very good translations and bad translations  , we computed the modified precision numbers on the output of a  ( good ) human translator and a standard ( poor ) machine translation system using 4 reference translations for each of 127 source sentences . The average precision results are shown in Figure  1  . 
Figure 1: Distinguishing Human from Machine                 The strong signal differentiating human  ( high precision ) from machine ( low precision ) is striking . 
The difference becomes stronger as wego from unigram precision to  4gram precision . It appears that any single ngram precision score can distinguish between a good translation and a bad translation  . 
To be useful , however , the metric must also reliably distinguish between translations that do not differs ogreatly in quality  . Furthermore , it must distinguish between two human translations of differing quality  . 
This latter requirement ensures the continued validity of the metric as MT approaches human translation quality  . 
To this end , we obtained a human translation by someone lacking native proficiency in both the source  ( Chinese ) and the target language ( English )  . 
For comparison , we acquired human translations of the same documents by a native English speaker  . We also obtained machine translations by three commercial systems  . These five ? systems ?? two humans and three machines ? are scored against two reference professional human translations  . The average modified ngram precision results are shown in Figure  2  . 
Each of these ngram statistics implies the same Figure  2: Machine and Human Translations                 ranking:  H2   ( Human2 ) is better than H1 ( Human1 )  , and there is a big drop in quality between H1 and S3   ( Machine/System-3 )  .   S3 appears better than S2 which in turn appears better than S1  . Remarkably , this is the same rank order assigned to these ? systems ? by human judges  , as we discuss later . While there seems to be ample signal in any single ngram precision  , it is more robust to combine all these signals into a single number metric  . 
2 . 1 . 3 Combining the modified ngram precisions How should we combine the modified precisions for the various ngram sizes ? A weighted linear average of the modified precisions resulted in encouraging results for the  5 systems . However , as can be seen in Figure 2 , the modified ngram precision decays roughly exponentially with n : the modified unigram precision is much larger than the modified bigram precision which in turn is much bigger than the modified trigram precision  . A reasonable averaging scheme must take this exponential decay into account  ; a weighted average of the logarithm of modified precisions satisifies this requirement  . 
BLEU uses the average logarithm with uniform weights  , which is equivalent to using the geometric mean of the modified ngram precisions  . 5  , 6 Experimentally , we obtain the best correlation with mono-5The geometric average is harsh if any of the modified precisions vanish  , but this should be an extremely rare event in test corpora of reasonable size  ( for Nmax ? 4 )  . 
6Using the geometric average also yields slightly stronger correlation with human judgments than our best results using an arithmetic average  . 
lingual human judgments using a maximum ngram order of  4  , although 3grams and 5grams give comparable results . 
2.2 Sentence length
A candidate translation should be neither too long nor too short  , and an evaluation metric should enforce this . To some extent , the ngram precision already accomplishes this . Ngram precision penalizes spurious words in the candidate that do not appear in any of the reference translations  . Additionally , modified precision is penalized if a word occurs more frequently in a candidate translation than its maximum reference count  . This rewards using a word as many times as warranted and penalizes using a word more times than it occurs in any of the references  . However , modified ngram precision alone fails to enforce the proper translation length  , as is illustrated in the short , absurd example below . 
Example 3:
Candidate : of the
Reference 1: It is a guide to action that ensures that the military will for everheed Party commands  . 
Reference 2: It is the guiding principle which guarantees the military forces always being under the command of the 

Reference 3: It is the practical guide for the army always to heed the directions of the party  . 
Because this candidate is so short compared to the proper length  , one expects to find inflated precisions : the modified unigram precision is  2/2  , and the modified bigram precision is 1/1 . 
2.2.1 The trouble with recall
Traditionally , precision has been paired with recall to overcome such length-related problems  . 
However , BLEU considers multiple reference translations , each of which may use a different word choice to translate the same source word  . Furthermore , a good candidate translation will only use ( recall ) one of these possible choices , but not all . Indeed , recalling all choices leads to a bad translation . 
Here is an example.
Example 4:
Candidate 1: I always invariably perpetu-ally do.
Candidate 2: I always do.
Reference 1: I always do.
Reference 2: I invariably do.
Reference 3: I perpetually do.
The first candidate recalls more words from the references  , but is obviously a poorer translation than the second candidate  . Thus , na??ve recall computed over the set of all reference words is not a good measure  . Admittedly , one could align the reference translations to discover synonymous words and compute recall on concepts rather than words  . But , given that reference translations vary in length and differ in word order and syntax  , such a computation is complicated . 
2.2.2 Sentence brevity penalty
Candidate translations longer than their references are already penalized by the modified ngram precision measure : there is no need to penalize them again  . Consequently , we introduce a multiplicative brevity penalty factor  . With this brevity penalty in place , a high-scoring candidate translation must now match the reference translations in length  , in word choice , and in word order . Note that neither this brevity penalty nor the modified ngram precision length effect directly considers the source length  ; instead , they consider the range of reference translation lengths in the target language  . 
We wish to make the brevity penalty 1 . 0 when the candidate?s length is the same as any reference trans-lation?s length  . For example , if there are three references with lengths 12 ,  15 , and 17 words and the candidate translation is a terse 12 words , we want the brevity penalty to be 1 . We call the closest reference sentence length the ? best match length  . ? One consideration remains : if we computed the brevity penalty sentence by sentence and averaged the penalties  , then length deviations on short sentences would be punished harshly  . Instead , we compute the brevity penalty over the entire corpus to allow some freedom at the sentence level  . We first compute the test corpus ? effective reference length  , r , by summing the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus  . We choose the brevity penalty to be a decaying exponential in r/c  , where c is the total length of the candidate translation corpus  . 
2.3 BLEU details
We take the geometric mean of the test corpus ? modified precision scores and then multiply the result by an exponential brevity penalty factor  . Currently , casefolding is the only text normalization performed before computing the precision  . 
We first compute the geometric average of the modified ngram precisions  , pn , using ngrams up to length N and positive weights wn summing to one  . 
Next , let c be the length of the candidate translation and r be the effective reference corpus length  . 
We compute the brevity penalty BP,
BP = 1 if c > re(1 ? r/c ) if c ? r.

BLEU = BP ? exp (
N ? n=1 wn log pn).
The ranking behavior is more immediately apparent in the log domain  , logBLEU = min(1 ? rc , 0)+
N ? n=1 wn log pn .
In our baseline , we use N = 4 and uniform weights wn = 1/N . 
3 The BLEU Evaluation
The BLEU metric ranges from 0 to 1 . Few translations will attain a score of 1 unless they are identical to a reference translation  . For this reason , even a human translator will not necessarily score  1  . It is important to note that the more reference translations per sentence there are  , the higher the score is . Thus , one must be cautious making even ? rough ? comparisons on evaluations with different numbers of reference translations : on a test corpus of about  500 sentences ( 40 general news stories )  , a human translator scored 0 . 3468 against four references and scored 0 . 2571 against two references . Table 1 shows the BLEU scores of the 5 systems against two references on this test corpus  . 
The MT systems S2 and S3 are very close in this metric . Hence , several questions arise:
Table 1: BLEU on 500 sentences
S1 S2 S3 H1 H20 . 0527 0 . 0829 0 . 0930 0 . 1934 0 . 2571 Table 2: Paired t-statistics on 20 blocks
S1 S2 S3 H1 H2
Mean 0.051 0.081 0.090 0.192 0.256
StdDev 0 . 017 0 . 025 0 . 020 0 . 030 0 . 039 t ? 63 . 4  24   11 ? Is the difference in BLEU metric reliable ?? What is the variance of the BLEU score ?? If we were to pick another random set of  500 sentences , would we still judge S3 to be better than S2? To answer these questions , we divided the test corpus into 20 blocks of 25 sentences each , and computed the BLEU metric on these blocks individually  . 
We thus have 20 samples of the BLEU metric for each system . We computed the means , variances , and paired t-statistics which are displayed in Table  2  . The t-statistic compares each system with its left neighbor in the table  . For example , t = 6 for the pair
S1 and S2.
Note that the numbers in Table 1 are the BLEU metric on an aggregate of 500 sentences , but the means in Table 2 are averages of the BLEU metric on aggregates of 25 sentences . As expected , these two sets of results are close for each system and differ only by small finite block size effects  . Since a paired t-statistic of 1 . 7 or above is 95% significant , the differences between the systems ? scores are statistically very significant  . The reported variance on 25-sentence blocks serves as an upper bound to the variance of sizeable test sets like the  500 sentence corpus . 
How many reference translations do we need ? We simulated a single-reference test corpus by randomly selecting one of the  4 reference translations as the single reference for each of the  40 stories . In this way , we ensured a degree of stylistic variation . 
The systems maintain the same rank order as with multiple references  . This outcome suggests that we may use a big test corpus with a single reference translation  , provided that the translations are not all from the same translator  . 
4 The Human Evaluation
We had two groups of human judges . The first group , called the monolingual group , consisted of 10 native speakers of English . The second group , called the bilingual group , consisted of 10 native speakers of Chinese who had lived in the United States for the past several years  . None of the human judges was a professional translator  . The humans judged our 5 standard systems on a Chinese sentence subset extracted at random from our  500 sentence test corpus . We paired each source sentence with each of its 5 translations , for a total of 250 pairs of Chinese source and English translations . We prepared a web page with these translation pairs randomly ordered to disperse the five translations of each source sentence  . All judges used this same web page and saw the sentence pairs in the same order  . They rated each translation from 1 ( very bad ) to 5 ( very good )  . 
The monolingual group made their judgments based only on the translations ? readability and fluency  . 
As must be expected , some judges were more liberal than others . And some sentences were easier to translate than others  . To account for the intrinsic difference between judges and the sentences  , we compared each judge?s rating for a sentence across systems  . We performed four pairwise ttest comparisons between adjacent systems as ordered by their aggregate average score  . 
4 . 1 Monolingual group pairwise judgments Figure 3 shows the mean difference between the scores of two consecutive systems and the  95% confidence interval about the mean . We see that S2 is quite a bit better than S1 ( by a mean opinion score difference of 0 . 326 on the 5-point scale ) , while S3 is judged a little better ( by 0 . 114) . Both differences are significant at the 95% level . 7 The human H1 is much better than the best system , though a bit worse than human H2 . This is not surprising given that H1 is not a native speaker of either Chinese or English  , 7 The 95% confidence interval comes from ttest , assuming that the data comes from a T -distribution with N degrees of freedom  . N varied from 350 to 470 as some judges have skipped some sentences in their evaluation  . Thus , the distribution is close to Gaussian . 
whereas H2 is a native English speaker . Again , the difference between the human translators is significant beyond the  95% level .

They also find that S3 is slightly better than S2   ( at 95% confidence ) though they judge that the human translations are much closer  ( in distinguishable at 95% confidence )  , suggesting that the bilinguals tended to focus more on adequacy than on fluency  .

The high correlation coefficient of 0 . 99 indicates that BLEU tracks human judgment well . Particularly interesting is how well BLEU distinguishes between  S2 and S3 which are quite close . Figure 6 shows the comparable regression results for the bilingual group  . The correlation coefficient is 0 . 96 .

We took the BLEU , monolingual group , and bilingual group scores for the 5 systems and linearly normalized them by their corresponding range  ( the maximum and minimum score across the 5 systems )  . The normalized scores are shown in Figure 7 . This figure illustrates the high correlation between the BLEU score and the monolingual group  . 
Of particular interest is the accuracy of BLEU?s estimate of the small difference between  S2 and S3 and the larger difference between S3 and H1  . The figure also highlights the relatively large gap between MT systems and human translators  . 8 In addition , we surmise that the bilingual group was very for giving in judging  H1 relative to H2 because the monolingual group found a rather large difference in the fluency of their translations  .

Our belief is reinforced by a recent statistical analysis of BLEU?s correlation with human judgment for translation into English from four quite different languages  ( Arabic , Chinese , French , Spanish ) representing 3 different language families ( Papineni et al ,  2002 ) ! BLEU?s strength is that it correlates highly with human  judg-8Crossing this chasm for ChineseEnglish translation appears to be a significant challenge for the current state-of-the-art systems  . 
ments by averaging out individual sentence judgment errors over a test corpus rather than attempting to divine the exact human judgment for every sentence : quantity leads to quality  . 
Finally , since MT and summarization can both be viewed as natural language generation from a textual context  , we believe BLEU could be adapted to evaluating summarization or similar NLG tasks  .
