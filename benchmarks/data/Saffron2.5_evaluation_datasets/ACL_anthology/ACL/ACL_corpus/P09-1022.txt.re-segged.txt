Abstract
This paper presents DEPEVAL(summ ), a dependency-based metric for automatic evaluation of summaries . Using a reranking parser and a Lexical-Functional Grammar ( LFG ) annotation , we produce a set of dependency triples for each summary . The dependency set for each candidate summary is then automatically compared against dependencies generated from model summaries . We examine a number of variations of the method , including the addition of WordNet , partial matching , or removing relation labels from the dependencies . In a test on TAC 2008 and DUC 2007 data , DE-
PEVAL(summ ) achieves comparable or higher correlations with human judgments than the popular evaluation metrics
ROUGE and Basic Elements ( BE).
1 Introduction
Evaluation is a crucial component in the area of automatic summarization ; it is used both to rank multiple participant systems in shared summarization tasks , such as the Summarization track at Text Analysis Conference ( TAC ) 2008 and its Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) predecessors , and to provide feedback to developers whose goal is to improve their summarization systems.
However , manual evaluation of a large number of documents necessary for a relatively unbiased view is often unfeasible , especially in the contexts where repeated evaluations are needed . Therefore , there is a great need for reliable automatic metrics that can perform evaluation in a fast and consistent manner.
In this paper , we explore one such evaluation metric , DEPEVAL(summ ), based on the comparison of Lexical-Functional Grammar ( LFG ) dependencies between a candidate summary and one or more model ( reference ) summaries . The method is similar in nature to Basic Elements ( Hovy et al , 2005), in that it extends beyond a simple string comparison of word sequences , reaching instead to a deeper linguistic analysis of the text . Both methods use handwritten extraction rules to derive dependencies from constituent parses produced by widely available Penn II Treebank parsers . The difference between
DEPEVAL(summ ) and BE is that in DEPE-
VAL(summ ) the dependency extraction is accomplished through an LFG annotation of Cahill et al . (2004) applied to the output of the reranking parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005), whereas in BE ( in the version presented here ) dependencies are generated by the Minipar parser ( Lin , 1995). Despite relying on a the same concept , our approach outperforms BE in most comparisons , and it often achieves higher correlations with human judgments than the string-matching metric
ROUGE ( Lin , 2004).
A more detailed description of BE and ROUGE is presented in Section 2, which also gives an account of manual evaluation methods employed at TAC 2008. Section 3 gives a short introduction to the LFG annotation . Section 4 describes in more detail DEPEVAL(summ ) and its variants . Section 5 presents the experiment in which we compared the perfomance of all three metrics on the TAC 2008 data ( consisting of 5,952 100-words summaries ) and on the DUC 2007 data (1,620 250-word summaries ) and discusses the correlations these metrics achieve . Finally , Section 6 presents conclusions and some directions for future work.
2 Current practice in summary evaluation In the first Text Analysis Conference ( TAC 2008), as well as its predecessor , the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) series , the evaluation manual and automatic methods . Since manual evaluation is still the undisputed gold standard , both at TAC and DUC there was much effort to evaluate manually as much data as possible.
2.1 Manual evaluation
Manual assessment , performed by human judges , usually centers around two main aspects of summary quality : content and form . Similarly to Machine Translation , where these two aspects are represented by the categories of Accuracy and Fluency , in automatic summarization evaluation performed at TAC and DUC they surface as ( Content ) Responsiveness and Readability . In TAC 2008 ( Dang and Owczarzak , 2008), however , Content Responsiveness was replaced by Overall Responsiveness , conflating these two dimensions and reflecting the overall quality of the summary : the degree to which a summary was responding to the information need contained in the topic statement , as well as its linguistic quality . A separate Readability score was still provided , assessing the fluency and structure independently of content , based on such aspects as grammaticality , non-redundancy , referential clarity , focus , structure , and coherence . Both Overall Responsiveness and Readability were evaluated according to a five-point scale , ranging from ? Very Poor ? to ? Very
Good?.
Content was evaluated manually by NIST assessors using the Pyramid framework ( Passonneau et al ., 2005). In the Pyramid evaluation , assessors first extract all possible ? information nuggets ?, or Summary Content Units ( SCUs ) from the four human-crafted model summaries on a given topic.
Each SCU is assigned a weight in proportion to the number of model summaries in which it appears , on the assumption that information which appears in most or all human-produced model summaries is more essential to the topic . Once all SCUs are harvested from the model summaries , assessors determine how many of these SCUs are present in each of the automatic peer summaries . The final score for an automatic summary is its total SCUweight divided by the maximum SCUweight available to a summary of average length ( where the average length is determined by the mean SCU count of the model summaries for this topic).
All types of manual assessment are expensive and time-consuming , which is why it can be rarely provided for all submitted runs in shared tasks such as the TAC Summarization track . It is also not a viable tool for system developers who ideally would like a fast , reliable , and above all automatic evaluation method that can be used to improve their systems . The creation and testing of automatic evaluation methods is , therefore , an important research venue , and the goal is to produce automatic metrics that will correlate with manual assessment as closely as possible.
2.2 Automatic evaluation
Automatic metrics , because of their relative speed , can be applied more widely than manual evaluation . In TAC 2008 Summarization track , all submitted runs were scored with the ROUGE ( Lin , 2004) and Basic Elements ( BE ) metrics ( Hovy et al ., 2005).
ROUGE is a collection of string-comparison techniques , based on matching ngrams between a candidate string and a reference string . The string in question might be a single sentence ( as in the case of translation ), or a set of sentences ( as in the case of summaries ). The variations of ROUGE range from matching unigrams ( i.e . single words ) to matching fourgrams , with or without lemmatization and stopwords , with the options of using different weights or skip-n-grams ( i.e.
matching ngrams despite intervening words ). The two versions used in TAC 2008 evaluations were
ROUGE2 and ROUGE-SU4, where ROUGE2 calculates the proportion of matching bigrams between the candidate summary and the reference summaries , and ROUGE-SU4 is a combination of unigram match and skip-bigram match with skip distance of 4 words.
BE , on the other hand , employs a certain degree of linguistic analysis in the assessment process , as it rests on comparing the ? Basic Elements ? between the candidate and the reference . Basic Elements are syntactic in nature , and comprise the heads of major syntactic constituents in the text ( noun , verb , adjective , etc .) and their modifiers in a dependency relation , expressed as a triple ( head , modifier , relation type ). First , the input text is parsed with a syntactic parser , then Basic Elements are extracted from the resulting parse , and the candidate BEs are matched against the reference BEs . In TAC 2008 and DUC 2008 evaluations the BEs were extracted with Minipar ( Lin , 1995). Since BE , contrary to ROUGE , does not termine similarity between summaries , but delves into what could be called a shallow semantic structure , comprising thematic roles such as subject and object , it is likely to notice identity of meaning where such identity is obscured by variations in word order . In fact , when it comes to evaluation of automatic summaries , BE shows higher correlations with human judgments than ROUGE , although the difference is not large enough to be statistically significant . In the TAC 2008 evaluations , BE-HM ( a version of BE where the words are stemmed and the relation type is ignored ) obtained a correlation of 0.911 with human assessment of overall responsiveness and 0.949 with the Pyramid score , whereas ROUGE2 showed correlations of 0.894 and 0.946, respectively.
While using dependency information is an important step towards integrating linguistic knowledge into the evaluation process , there are many ways in which this could be approached . Since this type of evaluation processes information in stages ( constituent parser , dependency extraction , and the method of dependency matching between a candidate and a reference ), there is potential for variance in performance among dependency-based evaluation metrics that use different components . Therefore , it is interesting to compare our method , which relies on the Charniak-Johnson parser and the LFG annotation , with BE , which uses Minipar to parse the input and produce dependencies.
3 Lexical-Functional Grammar and the
LFG parser
The method discussed in this paper rests on the assumptions of Lexical-Functional Grammar ( Kaplan and Bresnan , 1982; Bresnan , 2001) ( LFG ). In LFG sentence structure is represented in terms of c(onstituent)-structure and f(unctional)-structure.
C-structure represents the word order of the surface string and the hierarchical organisation of phrases in terms of trees . F-structures are recursive feature structures , representing abstract grammatical relations such as subject , object , oblique , adjunct , etc ., approximating to predicate-argument structure or simple logical forms . C-structure and f-structure are related by means of functional annotations in c-structure trees , which describe fstructures.
While c-structure is sensitive to surface rearrangement of constituents , f-structure abstracts away from ( some of ) the particulars of surface realization . The sentences John resigned yesterday and Yesterday , John resigned will receive different tree representations , but identical fstructures.
The f-structure can also be described in terms of a flat set of triples , or dependencies . In triples format , the f-structure for these two sentences is represented in 1.
(1) subject(resign,john ) person(john,3) number(john,sg ) tense(resign,past ) adjunct(resign,yesterday ) person(yesterday,3) number(yesterday,sg ) Cahill et al (2004), in their presentation of LFG parsing resources , distinguish 32 types of dependencies , divided into two major groups : a group of predicate-only dependencies and nonpredicate dependencies . Predicate-only dependencies are those whose path ends in a predicate-value pair , describing grammatical relations . For instance , in the sentence John resigned yesterday , predicate-only dependencies would include : subject(resign , john ) and adjunct(resign , yesterday ), while nonpredicate dependencies are per-son(john,3), number(john,sg ), tense(resign,past ), person(yesterday,3), num(yesterday,sg ). Other predicate-only dependencies include : apposition , complement , open complement , coordination , determiner , object , second object , oblique , second oblique , oblique agent , possessive , quantifier , relative clause , topic , and relative clause pronoun.
The remaining nonpredicate dependencies are : adjectival degree , coordination surface form , focus , complementizer forms : if , whether , and that , modal , verbal particle , participle , passive , pronoun surface form , and infinitival clause.
These 32 dependencies , produced by LFG annotation , and the overlap between the set of dependencies derived from the candidate summary and the reference summaries , form the basis of our evaluation method , which we present in Section 4.
First , a summary is parsed with the Charniak-Johnson reranking parser ( Charniak and Johnson , 2005) to obtain the phrase-structure tree . Then , a sequence of scripts annotates the output , translating the relative phrase position into f-structural dependencies . The treebank-based LFG annotation used in this paper and developed by Cahill et al . (2004) obtains high precision and recall rates.
As reported in Cahill et al (2008), the version of algorithm to the earlier Charniak?s parser ( Charniak , 2000) obtains an fscore of 86.97 on the Wall Street Journal Section 23 test set . The LFG parser is robust as well , with coverage levels exceeding 99.9%, measured in terms of complete spanning parse.
4 Dependency-based evaluation
Our dependency-based evaluation method , similarly to BE , compares two unordered sets of dependencies : one bag contains dependencies harvested from the candidate summary and the other contains dependencies from one or more reference summaries . Overlap between the candidate bag and the reference bag is calculated in the form of precision , recall , and the fmeasure ( with precision and recall equally weighted ). Since for ROUGE and BE the only reported score is recall , we present recall results here as well , calculated as in 2: (2) DEPEVAL(summ ) Recall = | Dcand|?|Dref || Dref | where Dcand are the candidate dependencies and Dref are the reference dependencies.
The dependency-based method using LFG annotation has been successfully employed in the evaluation of Machine Translation ( MT ). In Owczarzak (2008), the method achieves equal or higher correlations with human judgments than METEOR ( Banerjee and Lavie , 2005), one of the best-performing automatic MT evaluation metrics.
However , it is not clear that the method can be applied without change to the task of assessing automatic summaries ; after all , the two tasks - of summarization and translation - produce outputs that are different in nature . In MT , the unit of text is a sentence ; text is translated , and the translation evaluated , sentence by sentence . In automatic summarization , the output unit is a summary with length varying depending on task , but which most often consists of at least several sentences . This has bearing on the matching process : with several sentences on the candidate and reference side each , there is increased possibility of trivial matches , such as dependencies containing function words , which might inflate the summary score even in the absence of important content . This is particularly likely if we were to employ partial matching for dependencies . Partial matching ( indicated in the result tables with the tag pm ) ? splits ? each predicate dependency into two , replacing one or the other element with a variable , e.g . for the dependency subject(resign , John ) we would obtain two partial dependencies subject(resign , x ) and subject(x , John ). This process helps circumvent some of the syntactic and lexical variation between a candidate and a reference , and it proved very useful in MT evaluation ( Owczarzak , 2008). In summary evaluation , as will be shown in Section 5, it leads to higher correlations with human judgments only in the case of human-produced model summaries , because almost any variation between two model summaries is ? legal ?, i.e . either a paraphrase or another , but equally relevant , piece of information . For automatic summaries , which are of relatively poor quality , partial matching lowers our method?s ability to reflect human judgment , because it results in overly generous matching in situations where the examined information is neither a paraphrase nor relevant.
Similarly , evaluating a summary against the union of all references , as we do in the baseline version of our method , increases the pool of possible matches , but may also produce score inflation through matching repetitive information across models . To deal with this , we produce a version of the score ( marked in the result tables with the tag one ) that counts only one ? hit ? for every dependency match , independent of how many instances of a given dependency are present in the comparison.
The use of WordNet1 module ( Rennie , 2000) did not provide a great advantage ( see results tagged with wn ), and sometimes even lowered our correlations , especially in evaluation of automatic systems . This makes sense if we take into consideration that WordNet lists all possible synonyms for all possible senses of a word , and so , given a great number of cross-sentence comparisons in multi-sentence summaries , there is an increased risk of spurious matches between words which , despite being potentially synonymous in certain contexts , are not equivalent in the text.
Another area of concern was the potential noise introduced by the parser and the annotation process . Due to parsing errors , two otherwise equivalent expressions might be encoded as differing sets of dependencies . In MT evaluation , the dependency-based method can alleviate parser 1http://wordnet.princeton.edu / and the reference ( Owczarzak et al , 2007), but this is not an efficient solution for comparing multi-sentence summaries . We have therefore attempted to at least partially counteract this issue by removing relation labels from the dependencies ( i.e . producing dependencies of the form ( resign , John ) instead of subject(resign , John )), which did provide some improvement ( see results tagged with norel).
Finally , we experimented with a predicate-only version of the evaluation , where only the predicate dependencies participate in the comparison , excluding dependencies that provide purely grammatical information such as person , tense , or number ( tagged in the results table as pred ). This move proved beneficial only in the case of system summaries , perhaps by decreasing the number of trivial matches , but decreased the method?s correlation for model summaries , where such detailed information might be necessary to assess the degree of similarity between two human summaries.
5 Experimental results
The first question we have to ask is : which of the manual evaluation categories do we want our metric to imitate ? It is unlikely that a single automatic measure will be able to correctly reflect both Readability and Content Responsiveness , as form and content are separate qualities and need different measures . Content seems to be the more important aspect , especially given that Readability can be partially derived from Responsiveness ( a summary high in content cannot be very low in readability , although some very readable summaries can have little relevant content ). Content Responsiveness was provided in DUC 2007 data , but not in TAC 2008, where the extrinsic Pyramid measure was used to evaluate content . It is , in fact , preferable to compare our metric against the Pyramid score rather than Content Responsiveness , because both the Pyramid and our method aim to measure the degree of similarity between a candidate and a model , whereas Content Responsiveness is a direct assessment of whether the summary?s content is adequate given a topic and a source text . The Pyramid is , at the same time , a costly manual evaluation method , so an automatic metric that successfully emulates it would be a useful replacement.
Another question is whether we focus on system-level or summary-level evaluation . The correlation values at the summary-level are generally much lower than on the system-level , which means the metrics are better at evaluating system performance than the quality of individual summaries . System-level evaluations are essential to shared summarization tasks ; summary-level assessment might be useful to developers who want to test the effect of particular improvements in their system . Of course , the ideal evaluation metric would show high correlations with human judgment on both levels.
We used the data from the TAC 2008 and
DUC 2007 Summarization tracks . The first set comprised 58 system submissions and 4 human-produced model summaries for each of the 96 subtopics ( there were 48 topics , each of which required two summaries : a main and an update summary ), as well as human-produced Overall Responsiveness and Pyramid scores for each summary . The second set included 32 system submissions and 4 human models for each of the 45 topics . For fair comparison of models and systems , we used jackknifing : while each model was evaluated against the remaining three models , each system summary was evaluated four times , each time against a different set of three models , and the four scores were averaged.
5.1 System-level correlations
Table 1 presents system-level Pearson?s correlations between the scores provided by our dependency-based metric DEPEVAL(summ ), as well as the automatic metrics ROUGE2,
ROUGE-SU4, and BE-HM used in the TAC evaluation , and the manual Pyramid scores , which measured the content quality of the systems.
It also includes correlations with the manual Overall Responsiveness score , which reflected both content and linguistic quality . Table 3 shows the correlations with Content Responsiveness for DUC 2007 data for ROUGE , BE , and those few select versions of DEPEVAL(summ ) which achieve optimal results on TAC 2008 data ( for a more detailed discussion of the selection see
Section 6).
The correlations are listed for the following versions of our method : pm - partial matching for dependencies ; wn - WordNet ; pred - matching predicate-only dependencies ; norel - ignoring dependency relation label ; one - counting a match only once irrespective of how many instances of

The highest result in each category is marked by an asterisk . The background gradient indicates whether DEPEVAL(summ ) correlation is higher than all three competitors ROUGE2, ROUGE-SU4, and BE ( darkest grey ), two of the three ( medium grey ), one of the three ( light grey ), or none ( white ). The 95% confidence intervals are not included here for reasons of space , but their comparison suggests that none of the system-level differences in correlation levels are large enough to be significant . This is because the intervals themselves are very wide , due to relatively small number of summarizers (58 automatic and 8 human for TAC ; 32 automatic and 10 human for
DUC ) involved in the comparison.
5.2 Summary-level correlations
Tables 2 and 4 present the same correlations , but this time on the level of individual summaries . As before , the highest level in each category is marked by an asterisk . Contrary to system-level , here some correlations obtained by DEPEVAL(summ ) are significantly higher than those achieved by the three competing metrics,
ROUGE2, ROUGE-SU4, and BE-HM , as determined by the confidence intervals . The letters in parenthesis indicate that a given DEPE-VAL(summ ) variant is significantly better at correlating with human judgment than ROUGE2 (=
R2), ROUGE-SU4 (= R4), or BE-HM (= B).
6 Discussion and future work
It is obvious that none of the versions performs best across the board ; their different characteristics might render them better suited either for models or for automatic systems , but not for both at the same time . This can be explained if we understand that evaluating human gold standard summaries and automatically generated summaries of poor-to-medium quality is , in a way , not the same task . Given that human models are by default wellformed and relevant , relaxing any restraints on matching between them ( i.e . allowing partial dependencies , removing the relation label , or adding synonyms ) serves , in effect , to accept as correct either (1) the same conceptual information expressed in different ways ( where the difference might be real or introduced by faulty parsing ), or (2) other information , yet still relevant to the topic . Accepting information of the former type as correct will ratchet up the score for the summary and the correlation with the summary?s Pyramid score , which measures identity of information across summaries . Accepting the first and second type of information will raise the score and the correlation with Responsiveness , which measures relevance of information to the particular topic.
However , in evaluating system summaries such relaxation of matching constraints will result in accepting irrelevant and ungrammatical information as correct , driving up the DEPEVAL(summ ) score , but lowering its correlation with both Pyramid and Responsiveness . In simple words , it is okay to give a model summary ? the benefit of doubt ?, and accept its content as correct even if it is not matching other model summaries exactly , but the same strategy applied to a system summary might cause mass overestimation of the summary?s quality.
This substantial difference in the nature of human-generated models and system-produced summaries has impact on all automatic means of evaluation , as long as we are limited to methods that operate on more shallow levels than a full

semantic and pragmatic analysis against human-level world knowledge . The problem is twofold : first , our automatic metrics measure identity rather than quality . Similarity of content between a candidate summary and one or more references is acting as a proxy measure for the quality of the candidate summary ; yet , we cannot forget that the relation between these two features is not purely linear . A candidate highly similar to the reference will be , necessarily , of good quality , but a candidate which is dissimilar from a reference is not necessarily of low quality ( vide the case of parallel model summaries , which almost always contain some nonoverlapping information).
The second problem is the extent to which our metrics are able to distinguish content through the veil of differing forms . Synonyms , paraphrases , or pragmatic features such as the choice of topic and focus render simple string-matching techniques ineffective , especially in the area of summarization where the evaluation happens on a suprasentential level . As a result , then , a lot of effort was put into developing metrics that can identify similar content despite non-similar form , which naturally led to the application of linguistically-oriented approaches that look beyond surface word order.
Essentially , though , we are using imperfect measures of similarity as an imperfect stand-in for quality , and the accumulated noise often causes a divergence in our metrics ? performance with model and system summaries . Much like the inverse relation of precision and recall , changes and additions that improve a metric?s correlation with human scores for model summaries often weaken the correlation for system summaries , and vice versa . Admittedly , we could just ignore this problem and focus on increasing correlations for automatic summaries only ; after all , the whole point of creating evaluation metrics is to score and rank the output of systems . Such a perspective can be rather short-sighted , though , given that we expect continuous improvement from the summarization systems to , ideally , human levels , so the same issues which now prevent high correlations for models will start surfacing in evaluation of system-produced summaries as well . Using metrics that only perform reliably for low-quality summaries might prevent us from noticing when those summaries become better . Our goal should be , therefore , to develop a metric which obtains high correlations in both categories , with the assumption that such a metric will be more reliable in evaluating summaries of varying quality.

Since there is no single winner among all 32 variants of DEPEVAL(summ ) on TAC 2008 data , we must decide which of the categories is most important to a successful automatic evaluation metric . Correlations with Overall Responsiveness are in general lower than those with the Pyramid score ( except in the case of system-level models ). This makes sense , if we rememeber that Overall Responsiveness judges content as well as linguistic quality , which are two different dimensions and so a single automatic metric is unlikely to reflect it well , and that it judges content in terms of its relevance to topic , which is also beyond the reach of contemporary metrics which can at most judge content similarity to a model . This means that the Pyramid score makes for a more relevant metric to emulate.
The last dilemma is whether we choose to focus on system - or summary-level correlations . This ties in with the purpose which the evaluation metric should serve . In comparisons of multiple systems , such as in TAC 2008, the value is placed in the correct ordering of these systems ; while summary-level assessment can give us important feedback and insight during the system development stage.
The final choice among all DEPEVAL(summ ) versions hinges on all of these factors : we should prefer a variant which correlates highly with the Pyramid score rather than with Responsiveness , which minimizes the gap between model and automatic peer correlations while retaining relatively high values for both , and which fulfills these requirements similarly well on both summary - and system-levels . Three such variants are the baseline DEPEVAL(summ ), the WordNet version DE-PEVAL(summ ) wn , and the version with removed relation labels DEPEVAL(summ ) norel . Both the baseline and norel versions achieve significant improvement over ROUGE and BE in correlations with the Pyramid score for automatic summaries , and over BE for models , on the summary level . In fact , almost in all categories they achieve higher correlations than ROUGE and BE . The only exceptions are the correlations with Pyramid for systems at the system-level , but there the results are close and none of the differences in that category are significant . To balance this exception , DE-PEVAL(summ ) achieves much higher correlations with the Pyramid scores for model summaries than either ROUGE or BE on the system level.
In order to see whether the DEPEVAL(summ ) advantage holds for other data , we examined the most optimal versions ( baseline , wn , norel , as well as one , which is the closest counterpart to label-free BE-HM ) on data from DUC 2007.
Because only a portion of the DUC 2007 data was evaluated with Pyramid , we chose to look rather at the Content Responsiveness scores . As can be seen in Tables 3 and 4, the same patterns hold : decided advantage over ROUGE/BE when it comes to model summaries ( especially at system-level ), comparable results for automatic summaries . Since DUC 2007 data consisted of fewer summaries (1,620 vs 5,952 at TAC ) and fewer submissions (32 vs 57 at TAC ), some results did not reach statistical significance . In Table 3, in the models category , only DEPEVAL(summ ) correlations are significant . In Table 4, in the model category , only DEPEVAL(summ ) and ROUGE2 correlations are significant . Note also that these correlations with Content Responsiveness are generally lower than those with Pyramid in previous tables , but in the case of summary-level comparison higher than the correlations with Overall Responsiveness . This is to be expected given our earlier discussion of the differences in what these metrics measure.
As mentioned before , the dependency-based evaluation can be approached from different angles , leading to differences in performance . This is exemplified in our experiment , where DEPE-VAL(summ ) outperforms BE , even though both these metrics rest on the same general idea . The new implementation of BE presented at the TAC 2008 workshop ( Tratz and Hovy , 2008) introduces transformations for dependencies in order to increase the number of matches among elements that are semantically similar yet differ in terms of syntactic structure and/or lexical choices , and adds WordNet for synonym matching . Its core modules were updated as well : Minipar was replaced with the Charniak-Johnson reranking parser ( Charniak and Johnson , 2005), Named Entity identification was added , and the BE extraction is conducted using a set of Tregex rules ( Levy and Andrew , 2006).
Since our method , presented in this paper , also uses the reranking parser , as well as WordNet , it would be interesting to compare both methods directly in terms of the performance of the dependency extraction procedure.
