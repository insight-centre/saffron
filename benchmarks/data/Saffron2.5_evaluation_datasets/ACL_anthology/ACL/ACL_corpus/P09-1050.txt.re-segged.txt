Abstract
An important and well-studied problem is the production of semantic lexicons from a large corpus . In this paper , we present a system named ASIA ( Automatic Set Instance Acquirer ), which takes in the name of a semantic class as input ( e.g ., ? car makers ?) and automatically outputs its instances ( e.g ., ? ford ?, ? nissan ?, ? toyota?).
ASIA is based on recent advances in webbased set expansion - the problem of finding all instances of a set given a small number of ? seed ? instances . This approach effectively exploits web resources and can be easily adapted to different languages . In brief , we use language-dependent hyponym patterns to find a noisy set of initial seeds , and then use a state-of-the-art language-independent set expansion system to expand these seeds.
The proposed approach matches or outperforms prior systems on several Englishlanguage benchmarks . It also shows excellent performance on three dozen additional benchmark problems from English , Chinese and Japanese , thus demonstrating language-independence.
1 Introduction
An important and well-studied problem is the production of semantic lexicons for classes of interest ; that is , the generation of all instances of a set ( e.g ., ? apple ?, ? orange ?, ? banana ?) given a name of that set ( e.g ., ? fruits ?). This task is often addressed by linguistically analyzing very large collections of text ( Hearst , 1992; Kozareva et al , 2008; Etzioni et al , 2005; Pantel and Ravichandran , 2004; Pasca , 2004), often using hand-constructed or machine-learned shallow linguistic patterns to detect hyponym instances . A hyponym is a word or phrase whose semantic range Figure 1: Examples of SEAL?s input and output.
English entities are reality TV shows , Chinese entities are popular Taiwanese foods , and Japanese entities are famous cartoon characters.
is included within that of another word . For example , x is a hyponym of y if x is a ( kind of ) y . The opposite of hyponym is hypernym.
In this paper , we evaluate a novel approach to this problem , embodied in a system called ASIA1 ( Automatic Set Instance Acquirer ). ASIA takes a semantic class name as input ( e.g ., ? car makers ?) and automatically outputs instances ( e.g ., ? ford ?, ? nissan ?, ? toyota ?). Unlike prior methods , ASIA makes heavy use of tools for webbased set expansion . Set expansion is the task of finding all instances of a set given a small number of example ( seed ) instances . ASIA uses SEAL ( Wang and Cohen , 2007), a language-independent webbased system that performed extremely well on a large number of benchmark sets ? given three correct seeds , SEAL obtained average MAP scores in the high 90?s for 36 benchmark problems , including a dozen test problems each for English , Chinese and Japanese . SEAL works well in part because it can efficiently find and process many semistructured web documents containing instances of the set being expanded . Figure 1 shows some examples of
SEAL?s input and output.
SEAL has been recently extended to be robust to errors in its initial set of seeds ( Wang et al , 1http://rcwang.com/asia prove its performance ( Wang and Cohen , 2008).
These extensions allow ASIA to extract instances of sets from the Web , as follows . First , given a semantic class name ( e.g ., ? fruits ?), ASIA uses a small set of language-dependent hyponym patterns ( e.g ., ? fruits such as ?) to find a large but noisy set of seed instances . Second , ASIA uses the extended version of SEAL to expand the noisy set of seeds.
ASIA?s approach is motivated by the conjecture that for many natural classes , the amount of information available in semistructured documents on the Web is much larger than the amount of information available in freetext documents ; hence , it is natural to attempt to augment search for set instances in freetext with semistructured document analysis . We show that ASIA performs extremely well experimentally . On the 36 benchmarks used in ( Wang and Cohen , 2007), which are relatively small closed sets ( e.g ., countries , constellations , NBA teams ), ASIA has excellent performance for both recall and precision . On four additional Englishlanguage benchmark problems ( US states , countries , singers , and common fish ), we compare to recent work by Kozareva , Riloff , and Hovy ( Kozareva et al , 2008), and show comparable or better performance on each of these benchmarks ; this is notable because ASIA requires less information than the work of Kozareva et al(their system requires a concept name and a seed ). We also compare ASIA on twelve additional benchmarks to the extended Wordnet 2.1 produced by Snow et al(Snow et al , 2006), and show that for these twelve sets , ASIA produces more than five times as many set instances with much higher precision (98% versus 70%).
Another advantage of ASIA?s approach is that it is nearly language-independent : since the underlying set-expansion tools are language-independent , all that is needed to support a new target language is a new set of hyponym patterns for that language . In this paper , we present experimental results for Chinese and Japanese , as well as English , to demonstrate this language-independence.
We present related work in Section 2, and explain our proposed approach for ASIA in Section 3. Section 4 presents the details of our experiments , as well as the experimental results . A comparison of results are illustrated in Section 5, and the paper concludes in Section 6.
2 Related Work
There has been a significant amount of research done in the area of semantic class learning ( aka lexical acquisition , lexicon induction , hyponym extraction , or open-domain information extraction ). However , to the best of our knowledge , there is not a system that can perform set instance extraction in multiple languages given only the name of the set.
Hearst ( Hearst , 1992) presented an approach that utilizes hyponym patterns for extracting candidate instances given the name of a semantic set.
The approach presented in Section 3.1 is based on this work , except that we extended it to two other languages : Chinese and Japanese.
Pantel et al(Pantel and Ravichandran , 2004) presented an algorithm for automatically inducing names for semantic classes and for finding their instances by using ? concept signatures ? ( statistics on cooccuring instances ). Pasca ( Pasca , 2004) presented a method for acquiring named entities in arbitrary categories using lexicosyntactic extraction patterns . Etzioni et al(Etzioni et al , 2005) presented the KnowItAll system that also utilizes hyponym patterns to extract class instances from the Web . All the systems mentioned rely on either a English part-of-speech tagger , a parser , or both , and hence are language-dependent.
Kozareva et al(Kozareva et al , 2008) illustrated an approach that uses a single hyponym pattern combined with graph structures to learn semantic class from the Web . Section 5.1 shows that our approach is competitive experimentally ; however , their system requires more information , as it uses the name of the semantic set and a seed instance.
Pasca ( Pas?ca , 2007b ; Pas?ca , 2007a ) illustrated a set expansion approach that extracts instances from Web search queries given a set of input seed instances . This approach is similar in flavor to SEAL but , addresses a different task from that addressed here : for ASIA the user provides no seeds , but instead provides the name of the set being expanded . We compare to Pasca?s system in Section 5.2.
Snow et al(Snow et al , 2006) use known hyper-nym/hyponym pairs to generate training data for a machinelearning system , which then learns many lexicosyntactic patterns . The patterns learned are based on Englishlanguage dependency parsing.
We compare to Snow et als results in Section 5.3.
442 3 Proposed Approach
ASIA is composed of three main components : the Noisy Instance Provider , the Noisy Instance Expander , and the Bootstrapper . Given a semantic class name , the Provider extracts a initial set of noisy candidate instances using handcoded patterns , and ranks the instances by using a simple ranking model . The Expander expands and ranks the instances using evidence from semistructured web documents , such that irrelevant ones are ranked lower in the list . The Bootstrapper enhances the quality and completeness of the ranked list by using an unsupervised iterative technique . Note that the Expander and Bootstrapper rely on SEAL to accomplish their goals . In this section , we first describe the Noisy Instance Provider , then we briefly introduce SEAL , followed by the Noisy Instance Expander , and finally , the Bootstrapper.
3.1 Noisy Instance Provider
Noisy Instance Provider extracts candidate instances from free text ( i.e ., web snippets ) using the methods presented in Hearst?s early work ( Hearst , 1992). Hearst exploited several patterns for identifying hyponymy relation ( e.g ., such author as Shakespeare ) that many current state-of-the-art systems ( Kozareva et al , 2008; Pantel and Ravichandran , 2004; Etzioni et al , 2005; Pasca , 2004) are using . However , unlike all of those systems , ASIA does not use any NLP tool ( e.g ., parts-of-speech tagger , parser ) or rely on capitalization for extracting candidates ( since we wanted ASIA to be as language-independent as possible ). This leads to sets of instances that are noisy ; however , we will show that set expansion and reranking can improve the initial sets dramatically . Below , we will refer to the initial set of noisy instances extracted by the Provider as the initial set.
In more detail , the Provider first constructs a few queries of hyponym phrase by using a semantic class name and a set of predefined hyponym patterns . For every query , the Provider retrieves a hundred snippets from Yahoo !, and splits each snippet into multiple excerpts ( a snippet often contains multiple continuous excerpts from its web page ). For each excerpt , the Provider extracts all chunks of characters that would then be used as candidate instances . Here , we define a chunk as a sequence of characters bounded by punctuation marks or the beginning and end of an excerpt.
Figure 2: Hyponym patterns in English , Chinese , and Japanese . In each pattern , < C > is a placeholder for the semantic class name and < I > is a placeholder for its instances.
Lastly , the Provider ranks each candidate instance x based on its weight assigned by the simple ranking model presented below : weight(x ) = sf ( x,S ) | S | ? ef ( x,E ) | E | ? wcf ( x,E ) | C | where S is the set of snippets , E is the set of excerpts , and C is the set of chunks . sf ( x,S ) is the snippet frequency of x ( i.e ., the number of snippets containing x ) and ef ( x,E ) is the excerpt frequency of x . Furthermore , wcf ( x,E ) is the weighted chunk frequency of x , which is defined as follows : wcf ( x,E ) = ? e?E ? x?e where dist(x , e ) is the number of characters between x and the hyponym phrase in excerpt e.
This model weights every occurrence of x based on the assumption that chunks closer to a hyponym phrase are usually more important than those further away . It also heavily rewards frequency , as our assumption is that the most common instances will be more useful as seeds for SEAL.
Figure 2 shows the hyponym patterns we use for English , Chinese , and Japanese . There are two types of hyponym patterns : The first type are the ones that require the class name C to precede its instance I ( e.g ., C such as I ), and the second type are the opposite ones ( e.g ., I and other C ). In order to reduce irrelevant chunks , when excerpts were extracted , the Provider drops all characters preceding the hyponym phrase in excerpts that contain the first type , and also drops all characters following the hyponym phrase in excerpts that contain the second type . For some semantic class names ( e.g ., ? cmu buildings ?), there are no web queries that were constructed using the name . In this case , the Provider turns to a backoff strategy which simply treats the semantic class name as the hyponym phrase and extracts/ranks all chunks cooccurring with the class name in the excerpts.
3.2 Set Expander - SEAL
In this paper , we rely on a set expansion system named SEAL ( Wang and Cohen , 2007), which stands for Set Expander for Any Language . The system accepts as input a few seeds of some target set S ( e.g ., ? fruits ?) and automatically finds other probable instances ( e.g ., ? apple ?, ? banana ?) of S in web documents . As its name implies , SEAL is independent of document languages : both the written ( e.g ., English ) and the markup language ( e.g ., HTML ). SEAL is a research system that has shown good performance in published results ( Wang and Cohen , 2007; Wang et al , 2008; Wang and Cohen , 2008). Figure 1 shows some examples of SEAL?s input and output.
In more detail , SEAL contains three major components : the Fetcher , Extractor , and Ranker . The Fetcher is responsible for fetching web documents , and the URLs of the documents come from top results retrieved from the search engine using the concatenation of all seeds as the query.
This ensures that every fetched web page contains all seeds . The Extractor automatically constructs ? wrappers ? ( i.e . page-specific extraction rules ) for each page that contains the seeds . Every wrapper comprises two character strings that specify the left and right contexts necessary for extracting candidate instances . These contextual strings are maximally-long contexts that bracket at least one occurrence of every seed string on a page . All other candidate instances bracketed by these contextual strings derived from a particular page are extracted from the same page.
After the candidates are extracted , the Ranker constructs a graph that models all the relations between documents , wrappers , and candidate instances . Figure 3 shows an example graph where each node di represents a document , wi a wrapper , and mi a candidate instance . The Ranker performs Random Walk with Restart ( Tong et al , 2006) on this graph ( where the initial ? restart ? set is the set of seeds ) until all node weights converge , and then ranks nodes by their final score ; thus nodes are weighted higher if they are connected to many Figure 3: An example graph constructed by SEAL . Every edge from node x to y actually has an inverse relation edge from node y to x that is not shown here ( e.g ., m1 is extracted by w1).
seed nodes by many short , low fanout paths . The final expanded set contains all candidate instance nodes , ranked by their weights in the graph.
3.3 Noisy Instance Expander
Wang ( Wang et al , 2008) illustrated that it is feasible to perform set expansion on noisy input seeds.
The paper showed that the noisy output of any Question Answering system for list questions can be improved by using a noise-resistant version of SEAL ( An example of a list question is ? Who were the husbands of Heddy Lamar ??). Since the initial set of candidate instances obtained using Hearst?s method are noisy , the Expander expands them by performing multiple iterations of set expansion using the noise-resistant SEAL.
For every iteration , the Expander performs set expansion on a static collection of web pages . This collection is pre-fetched by querying Google and Yahoo ! using the input class name and words such as ? list ?, ? names ?, ? famous ?, and ? common ? for discovering web pages that might contain lists of the input class . In the first iteration , the Expander expands instances with scores of at least k in the initial set . In every upcoming iteration , it expands instances obtained in the last iteration that have scores of at least k and that also exist in the initial set . We have determined k to be 0.4 based on our development set2. This process repeats until the set of seeds for ith iteration is identical to that of ( i ? 1)th iteration.
There are several differences between the original SEAL and the noise-resistant SEAL . The most important difference is the Extractor . In the origi-2A collection of closed-set lists such as planets , Nobel prizes , and continents in English , Chinese and Japanese mon contexts to bracket at least one instance of every seed per web page . However , when seeds are noisy , such common contexts usually do not exist . The Extractor in noise-resistant SEAL solves this problem by requiring the contexts to bracket at least one instance of a minimum of two seeds , rather than every seed . This is implemented using a trie-based method described briefly in the original SEAL paper ( Wang and Cohen , 2007). In this paper , the Expander utilizes a slightly-modified version of the Extractor , which requires the contexts to bracket as many seed instances as possible.
This idea is based on the assumption that irrelevant instances usually do not have common contexts ; whereas relevant ones do.
3.4 Bootstrapper
Bootstrapping ( Etzioni et al , 2005; Kozareva , 2006; Nadeau et al , 2006) is an unsupervised iterative process in which a system continuously consumes its own outputs to improve its own performance . Wang ( Wang and Cohen , 2008) showed that it is feasible to bootstrap the results of set expansion to improve the quality of a list . The paper introduces an iterative version of SEAL called iSEAL , which expands a list in multiple iterations.
In each iteration , iSEAL expands a few candidates extracted in previous iterations and aggregates statistics . The Bootstrapper utilizes iSEAL to further improve the quality of the list returned by the Expander.
In every iteration , the Bootstrapper retrieves 25 web pages by using the concatenation of three seeds as query to each of Google and Yahoo!.
In the first iteration , the Bootstrapper expands randomly-selected instances returned by the Expander that exist in the initial set . In every upcoming iteration , the Bootstrapper expands randomly-selected unsupervised instances obtained in the last iteration that also exist in the initial set . This process terminates when all possible seed combinations have been consumed or five iterations3 have been reached , whichever comes first . Notice that from iteration to iteration , statistics are aggregated by growing the graph described in Section 3.2. We perform Random Walk with Restart ( Tong et al , 2006) on this graph to determine the final ranking of the extracted instances.
3To keep the overall runtime minimal.
4 Experiments 4.1 Datasets
We evaluated our approach using the evaluation set presented in ( Wang and Cohen , 2007), which contains 36 manually constructed lists across three different languages : English , Chinese , and Japanese (12 lists per language ). Each list contains all instances of a particular semantic class in a certain language , and each instance contains a set of synonyms ( e.g ., USA , America ). There are a total of 2515 instances , with an average of 70 instances per semantic class . Figure 4 shows the datasets and their corresponding semantic class names that we use in our experiments.
4.2 Evaluation Metric
Since the output of ASIA is a ranked list of extracted instances , we choose mean average precision ( MAP ) as our evaluation metric . MAP is commonly used in the field of Information Retrieval for evaluating ranked lists because it is sensitive to the entire ranking and it contains both recall and precision-oriented aspects . The MAP for multiple ranked lists is simply the mean value of average precisions calculated separately for each ranked list . We define the average precision of a single ranked list as:
AvgPrec(L ) = | L |? r=1
Prec(r )? isFresh(r)
Total # of Correct Instances where L is a ranked list of extracted instances , r is the rank ranging from 1 to | L |, Prec(r ) is the precision at rank r . isFresh(r ) is a binary function for ensuring that , if a list contains multiple synonyms of the same instance , we do not evaluate that instance more than once . More specifically , the function returns 1 if a ) the synonym at r is correct , and b ) it is the highestranked synonym of its instance in the list ; it returns 0 otherwise.
4.3 Experimental Results
For each semantic class in our dataset , the Provider first produces a noisy list of candidate instances , using its corresponding class name shown in Figure 4. This list is then expanded by the Expander and further improved by the Bootstrapper.
We present our experimental results in Table 1.

quality of the initial list , and the Bootstrapper then enhances it further more . On average , the Expander improves the performance of the Provider from 37% to 80% for English , 24% to 82% for Chinese , and 12% to 89% for Japanese . The Bootstrapper then further improves the performance of the Expander to 82%, 87% and 91% respectively.
In addition , the results illustrate that the Bootstrapper is also effective even without the Expander ; it directly improves the performance of the Provider from 37% to 77% for English , 24% to 52% for
Chinese , and 12% to 39% for Japanese.
The simple backoff strategy seems to be effective as well . There are five datasets ( marked with * in Table 1) of which their hyponym phrases return zero web documents . For those datasets , ASIA automatically uses the backoff strategy described in Section 3.1. Considering only those five datasets , the Expander , on average , improves the performance of the Provider from 2% to 53% and the
Bootstrapper then improves it to 55%.
5 Comparison to Prior Work
We compare ASIA?s performance to the results of three previously published work . We use the best-configured ASIA ( NP+NE+BS ) for all comparisons , and we present the comparison results in this section.
5.1 ( Kozareva et al , 2008)
Table 2 shows a comparison of our extraction performance to that of Kozareva ( Kozareva et al , 2008). They report results on four tasks : US states , countries , singers , and common fish . We evaluated our results manually . The results indicate that ASIA outperforms theirs for all four datasets that they reported . Note that the input to their system is a semantic class name plus one seed instance ; whereas , the input to ASIA is only the class name . In terms of system runtime , for each semantic class , Kozareva et alreported that their extraction process usually finished overnight ; however , ASIA usually finished within a minute.

5.2 ( Pas?ca , 2007b)
We compare ASIA to Pasca ( Pas?ca , 2007b ) and present comparison results in Table 3. There are ten semantic classes in his evaluation dataset , and the input to his system for each class is a set of seed entities rather than a class name . We evaluate every instance manually for each class . The results show that , on average , ASIA performs better.
However , we should emphasize that for the three classes : movie , person , and video game , ASIA did not initially converge to the correct instance list given the most natural concept name.
Given ? movies ?, ASIA returns as instances strings like ? comedy ?, ? action ?, ? drama ?, and other kinds of movies . Given ? video games ?, it returns ? PSP ?, ? Xbox ?, ? Wii ?, etc . Given ? people ?, it returns ? musicians ?, ? artists ?, ? politicians ?, etc . We addressed this problem by simply rerunning ASIA with a more specific class name ( i.e ., the first one returned ); however , the result suggests that future work is needed to support automatic construction of hypernym hierarchy using semistructured web documents.
5.3 ( Snow et al , 2006)
Snow ( Snow et al , 2006) has extended the WordNet 2.1 by adding thousands of entries ( synsets ) at a relatively high precision . They have made several versions of extended WordNet available4.
For comparison purposes , we selected the version (+30K ) that achieved the best Fscore in their experiments.

Table 3: Set instance extraction performance compared to Pasca . We report our precision for all semantic classes and at the same ranks reported in his work.
For the experimental comparison , we focused on leaf semantic classes from the extended WordNet that have many hypernyms , so that a meaningful comparison could be made : specifically , we selected nouns that have at least three hypernyms , such that the hypernyms are the leaf nodes in the hypernym hierarchy of WordNet . Of these , 210 were extended by Snow . Preliminary experiments showed that ( as in the experiments with Pasca?s classes above ) ASIA did not always converge to the intended meaning ; to avoid this problem , we instituted a second filter , and discarded ASIA?s results if the intersection of hypernyms from ASIA and WordNet constituted less than 50% of those in WordNet . About 50 of the 210 nouns passed this filter . Finally , we manually evaluated precision and recall of a randomly selected set of twelve of these 50 nouns.
We present the results in Table 4. We used a fixed cutoff score5 of 0.3 to truncate the ranked list produced by ASIA , so that we can compute precision . Since only a few of these twelve nouns are closed sets , we cannot generally compute recall ; instead , we define relative recall to be the ratio of correct instances to the union of correct instances from both systems . As shown in the results , ASIA has much higher precision , and much higher relative recall . When we evaluated Snow?s extended WordNet , we assumed all instances that 5Determined from our development set.

6 Conclusions
In this paper , we have shown that ASIA , a SEAL-based system , extracts set instances with high precision and recall in multiple languages given only the set name . It obtains a high MAP score (87%) averaged over 36 benchmark problems in three languages ( Chinese , Japanese , and English ). Figure 5 shows some real examples of ASIA?s input and output in those three languages . ASIA?s approach is based on webbased set expansion using semistructured documents , and is motivated by the conjecture that for many natural classes , the amount of information available in semistructured documents on the Web is much larger than the amount of information available in freetext documents . This conjecture is given some support by our experiments : for instance , ASIA finds 457 instances of the set ? film director ? with perfect precision , whereas Snow et als state-of-the-art methods for extraction from free text extract only four correct instances , with only 50% precision.
ASIA?s approach is also quite language-independent . By adding a few simple hyponym patterns , we can easily extend the system to support other languages . We have also shown that Hearst?s method works not only for English , but also for other languages such as Chinese and Japanese . We note that the ability to construct semantic lexicons in diverse languages has obvious applications in machine translation . We have also illustrated that ASIA outperforms three other English systems ( Kozareva et al , 2008; Pas?ca , 2007b ; Snow et al , 2006), even though many of these use more input than just a semantic class name . In addition , ASIA is also quite efficient , requiring only a few minutes of computation and couple hundreds of web pages per problem.
In the future , we plan to investigate the possibility of constructing hypernym hierarchy automatically using semistructured documents . We also plan to explore whether lexicons can be constructed using only the backoff method for hyponym extraction , to make ASIA completely language independent . We also wish to explore whether performance can be improved by simultaneously finding class instances in multiple languages ( e.g ., Chinese and English ) while learning translations between the extracted instances.
