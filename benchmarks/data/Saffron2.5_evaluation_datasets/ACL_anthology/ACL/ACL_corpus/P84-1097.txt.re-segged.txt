A dictionary is an extremely valuable reference book  , but its familiarity tends to blind adults to the high level of intelligence required to read it  . This aspect becomes apparent , however , when school children are observed learning dictionary skills  . 
Children do not respect syntactic ategory and often wander into the wrong lexieai entry  , apparently in search of something they can understand  . They also find it difficult to match the sense of a polysemous word to the context of a particular passage  . And they repeatedly assume that some familiar word in a definition can be substituted for the unfamiliar word it defines  . 
The lexical information that children need can be provided better by a computer than by a book  , but that remedy will not be realized if automated dictionaries are merely machine-readable versions of the standard printed dictionaries  . Some suggestions for computer-based lexieal reference systems will be offered  .
