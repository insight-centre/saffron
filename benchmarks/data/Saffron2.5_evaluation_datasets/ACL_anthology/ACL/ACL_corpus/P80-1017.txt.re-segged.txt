Interactive Discourse : Influence of the Social Context 
Panel Chair's Introduction
Jerry R . Hobbs

Progress on natural language interfaces can perhaps be stimulated or directed by imagining the ideal natural language system of the future  . What features ( or even design philosophies ) should such a system have in order to become an integral part of our work environments ? What scaled-down versions of these features might be possible in the near future in " simple service systems "  \[2\]? These issues can be broken down into the following four questions : i  . What are the significant features of the environment in which the system will reside ? The system will be one participant in an intricate information network  , depending on a continually reinforced shared complex of knowledge  \[9\]  . To be an integral part of this environment , the system must possess some of the shared knowledge and perhaps must participate in its reinforcement  , e . g . via explanations ,\[9\],\[2\] . 
2 . Investigations of person person communication sho111d tell us what person-system communication ought to be like  . Face-to-face conversation is extraord in a rily rich in the information that is conveyed by various means  , such as gesture , body position , gaze direction \[4\] ,  \[8\] . 
In addition to conveying propositional content or infor-mstion  , what are the principal functions that moves in conversation perform ? a  . Organization of the interaction , regulation of turns\[7\] , \[ i \] . In the natural language dialog systems of today , each turn consists of a sentence or less . In experiments done at SRI on instruction dialogs between people over computer terminals  , the instructor's turns usually involve long texts  . It was discovered that the student needs a way of interrupting  . That is , some sort of turntaking mechanisms are required , what can we learn from the turntaking mechanisms people use ? b  . Orientation of the participants toward each other  , including recognition \[6\] , expressions of solidarity and indications of agreement and disagreement  \[3\]  , meta-comments on the direction of the conversation  \[8\] or the reasons for certain utterances ( \[9\] on discourse explanations )  . 
c . Maintenance of the channel of cO~unication , implic-it acknowledgment or verification of information conveyed  \[2\]  . Recovery from mistakes and break downs in commtunication  \[8\]  , e . g . via flexibility in parsing and interpretation \[2\]  ; via explicit indications of in-comprehension \[2\] and repairs \[5\]  . In natural language systems of today , when the user makes a mistake and the system fails to interpret the input  , the user must usually begin over again . The system cannot use whatever it didget from the mistake to aid in the interpretation of the repair  . People are more efficient , what are the principal means of repair that people use  , and how can they be carried over to natural language systems ? taining one's role  , e . g . as a competent , cooperative participant ( cf .  \[8\] ;  \[9\] ; \[ i \] for the role of speech style ; \[4\] for defense of competence) . In addition to the system having a model of the user  , the user will have a model of the system , determined by the nature of his interaction with it  . The system should thus be tailored to convey an accurate image of what the system can do  . For example , superficial politeness or fluency ( " Goodmorning , Jerry . What can I do for you today ?" ) is more likely to mislead the user about the system's capabilities than to ease the interaction  . What the system does , via lexical choice , indirect speech acts , polite forms , etc . , to maintain its role in the interaction should arise out of a coherent view of what the role is  . The linguistic competence of the system is an important element of the image it conveys to the user  \[2\]  . 
3 . When we move from face-to-face conversations to dialogs over computer terminals  , the communication is purely verbal . The work done nonverbally now has to be realized verbally  . How are the realizations of the above functions altered over the change of channels  \[6\]? We know , for example , that there are more utterances showing solidarity and asking for opinions  , because this is work done nonverbally face-to -face  \[3\]  . 
Somethings that occur face-to-face ( e . g . tension release , jokes ) seem to be expendable over computer terminals , where each utterance costs the speaker more . 
The messages take longer to produce , are less transi-tory , and can be absorbed more carefully , so there is less asking for orientation , elaboration , and correction \[3\] . What devices are likely to be borrowed from related but more familiar communication frames \ [ i \] ? Possible frames are letters or telephone conversations  . 
4 . Should and how can these functions be incorporated into the ideal natural language systems of the far future and the simple service systems of the near future  \[2\]  ,  \[8\]?
