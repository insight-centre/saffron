Abstract
Statistical machine learning methods are employed to train a Named Entity Recognizer from annotated data . Methods like Maximum Entropy and Conditional Random Fields make use of features for the training purpose.
These methods tend to overfit when the available training corpus is limited especially if the number of features is large or the number of values for a feature is large . To overcome this we proposed two techniques for feature reduction based on word clustering and selection . A number of word similarity measures are proposed for clustering words for the Named Entity Recognition task . A few corpus based statistical measures are used for important word selection . The feature reduction techniques lead to a substantial performance improvement over baseline Maximum
Entropy technique.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) involves locating and classifying the names in a text . NER is an important task , having applications in information extraction , question answering , machine translation and in most other Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) applications . NER systems have been developed for English and few other languages with high accuracy . These belong to two main categories based on machine learning ( Bikel et al , 1997; Borthwick , 1999; McCallum and Li , 2003) and language or domain specific rules ( Grishman , 1995;
Wakao et al , 1996).
In English , the names are usually capitalized which is an important clue for identifying a name.
Absence of capitalization makes the Hindi NER task difficult . Also , person names are more diverse in Indian languages , many common words being used as names.
A pioneering work on Hindi NER is by Li and McCallum (2003) where they used Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) and feature induction to automatically construct only the features that are important for recognition . In an effort to reduce overfitting , they use a combination of a Gaussian prior and early-stopping.
In their Maximum Entropy ( MaxEnt ) based approach for Hindi NER development , Saha et al (2008) also observed that the performance of the MaxEnt based model often decreases when huge number of features are used in the model . This is due to overfitting which is a serious problem in most of the NLP tasks in resource poor languages where annotated data is scarce.
This paper is a study on effectiveness of word clustering and selection as feature reduction techniques for MaxEnt based NER . For clustering we use a number of word similarities like cosine similarity among words and cooccurrence , along with the kmeans clustering algorithm . The clusters are then used as features instead of words . For important word selection we use corpus based statistical measurements to find the importance of the words in the NER task . A significant performance improvement over baseline MaxEnt was observed after using the above feature reduction techniques.
The paper is organized as follows . The MaxEnt ous approaches for word clustering are discussed in Section 3. Next section presents the procedure for selecting the important words . In Section 5 experimental results and related discussions are given . Finally Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Maximum Entropy Based Model for
Hindi NER
Maximum Entropy ( MaxEnt ) principle is a commonly used technique which provides probability of belongingness of a token to a class . MaxEnt computes the probability p(o|h ) for any o from the space of all possible outcomes O , and for every h from the space of all possible histories H . In NER , history can be viewed as all information derivable from the training corpus relative to the current token . The computation of probability ( p(o|h )) of an outcome for a token in MaxEnt depends on a set of features that are helpful in making predictions about the outcome . The features may be binary-valued or multivalued . Given a set of features and a training corpus , the MaxEnt estimation process produces a model in which every feature fi has a weight ? i . We can compute the conditional probability as ( Berger et al , 1996): p(o|h ) = ? i ? i fi(h,o ) (1)
Z(h ) = ? o ? i ? i fi(h,o ) (2)
The conditional probability of the outcome is the product of the weights of all active features , normalized over the products of all the features . For our development we have used a Java based opennlp MaxEnt toolkit1. A beam search algorithm is used to get the most probable class from the probabilities.
2.1 Training Corpus
The training data for the Hindi NER task is composed of about 243K words which is collected from the popular daily Hindi newspaper ? Dainik Jagaran ?. This corpus has been manually annotated and contains about 16,491 Named Entities ( NEs ). In this study we have considered 4 types 1http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxent/
Type Features
Word wi , wi?1, wi?2, wi+1, wi+2
NE Tag ti?1, ti?2
Digit information
Contains digit , Only digit , Four digit , Numerical word
Affix information
Fixed length suffix , Suffix list,
Fixed length prefix

Table 1: Features used in the MaxEnt based Hindi NER system of NEs , these are Person ( Per ), Location ( Loc ), Organization ( Org ) and Date ( Dat ). To recognize entity boundaries each name class N has 4 types of labels : N Begin , N Continue , N End and N Unique . For example , Kharagpur is annotated as Loc Unique and Atal Bihari Vajpeyi is annotated as Per Begin Per Continue Per End . Hence , there are a total of 17 classes including one class for notname . The corpus contains 6298 person , 4696 location , 3652 organization and 1845 date entities.
2.2 Feature Description
We have identified a number of candidate features for the Hindi NER task . Several experiments were conducted with the identified features , individually and in combination . Some of the features are mentioned below . They are summarized in Table 1.
Static Word Feature : Recognition of NE is highly dependent on contexts . So the surrounding words of a particular word ( wi ) are used as features . During our experiments different combinations of previous 3 words ( wi?3...wi?1) to next 3 words ( wi+1...wi+3) are treated as features . This is represented by L binary features where L is the size of lexicon.
Dynamic NE tag : NE tags of the previous words ( ti?m...ti?1) are used as features . During decoding , the value of this feature for a word ( wi ) is obtained only after the computation of the NE tag for the previous word ( wi?1).
Digit Information : If a word ( wi ) contains digit(s ) then the feature ContainsDigit is set to 1.
This feature is used with some modifications also.
OnlyDigit , which is set to 1 if the word contains F1 wi , wi?1, wi+1 61.36 68.29 52.12 88.9 67.26 F2 wi , wi?1, wi?2, wi+1, wi+2 64.10 67.81 58 92.30 69.09
F3 wi , wi?1, wi?2, wi?3, wi+1, wi+2, wi+3 60.42 67.81 51.48 90.18 66.84
F4 wi , wi?1, wi?2, wi+1, wi+2, ti?1, ti?2, Suffix 66.67 73.36 58.58 89.09 71.2 F5 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Suffix 69.65 75.8 59.31 89.09 73.42 F6 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Prefix 66.67 71 58.58 87.8 70.02
F7 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Prefix,
Suffix 70.61 71 59.31 89.09 72.5
F8 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Suffix,
Digit 70.61 75.8 60.54 93.8 74.26
F9 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, POS (28 tags ) 64.25 71 60.54 89.09 70.39
F10 wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, POS ( coarse grained ) 69.65 75.8 59.31 92.82 74.16
F11 wi , wi?1, wi+1, Ti?1, Suffix,
Digit , NomPSP 72.26 78.6 61.36 92.82 75.6
F12 wi , wi?1, wi+1, wi?2, wi+2,
Ti?1, Prefix , Suffix , Digit,
NomPSP 65.26 78.01 52.12 93.33 72.65
Table 2: F-values for different features in the MaxEnt based Hindi NER system only digits , 4Digit , which is set to 1 if the word contains only 4 digits , etc . are some modifications of the feature which are helpful.
Numerical Word : For a word ( wi ) if it is a numerical word i.e . word denoting a number ( e.g . eka2 ( one ), do ( two ), tina ( three ) etc .) then the feature
NumWord is set to 1.
Word Suffix : Word suffix information is helpful to identify the NEs . Two types of suffix features have been used . Firstly a fixed length word suffix ( set of characters occurring at the end of the word ) of the current and surrounding words are used as features . Secondly we compiled list of common suffixes of place names in Hindi . For example , pura , bAda , nagara etc . are location suffixes . We used binary feature corresponding to the list - whether a given word has a suffix from the list.
Word Prefix : Prefix information of a word may be also helpful in identifying whether it is a NE . A 2All Hindi words are written in italics using the ? Itrans ? transliteration.
fixed length word prefix ( set of characters occurring at the beginning of the word ) of current and surrounding words are treated as features . List of important prefixes , which are used frequently in the
NEs , are also effective.
Parts-of-Speech ( POS ) Information : The POS of the current word and the surrounding words are used as feature for NER . We have used a Hindi POS tagger developed at IIT Kharagpur , India which has an accuracy about 90%. We have used the POS values of the current and surrounding words as features.
We realized that the detailed POS tagging is not very relevant . Since NEs are noun phrases , the noun tag is very relevant . Further the postposition following a name may give a clue to the NE type . So we decided to use a coarse-grained tagset with only three tags - nominal ( Nom ), postposition ( PSP ) and other ( O).
The POS information is also used by defining several binary features . An example is the NomPSP binary feature . The value of this feature is defined to be 1 if the current word is nominal and the next 2.3 Performance of Hindi NER using MaxEnt
Method
The performance of the MaxEnt based Hindi NER using the above mentioned features is reported here as a baseline . We have evaluated the system using a blind test corpus of 25K words . The test corpus contains 521 person , 728 location , 262 organization and 236 date entities . The accuracies are measured in terms of the fmeasure , which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall . Precision is the fraction of the correct annotations and recall is the fraction of the total NEs that are successfully annotated . The general formula for measuring the fmeasure or fvalue is , F ? = (1+?2) . ( precision . recall ) \ (?2 . precision + recall ). Here the value of ? is taken as 1. In Table 2 we have shown the accuracy values for few feature sets.
While experimenting with static word features , we have observed that a window of previous and next two words ( wi?2...wi+2) gives best result (69.09) using the word features only . But whenwi?3 and wi+3 are added with it , the fvalue is reduced to 66.84. Again when wi?2 and wi+2 are deducted from the feature set ( i.e . only wi?1 and wi+1 as feature ), the fvalue is reduced to 67.26. This demonstrates thatwi?2 andwi+2 are helpful features in NE identification.
When suffix , prefix and digit information are added to the feature set , the fvalue is increased upto 74.26. The value is obtained using the feature set F8 [ wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Suffix , Digit ]. It is observed that when wi?2 and wi+2 are added with the feature , the accuracy decreases by 2%. It contradicts the results using the word features only . Another interesting observation is that prefix information are helpful features in NE identification as these increase accuracy when separately added with the word features ( F6). Similarly the suffix information helps in increasing the accuracy . But when both the suffix and prefix information are used in combination along with the word features , the fvalue is decreased . From Table 2, a fvalue of 73.42 is obtained using F5 [ wi , wi?1, wi+1, ti?1, Suffix ] but when prefix information are added with it ( F7), the fvalue is reduced to 72.5.
POS information are important features in NER.
In general it is observed that coarse grained POS information performs better than the finer grained POS information . The best accuracy (75.6 fvalue ) of the baseline system is obtained using the binary NomPSP feature along with word feature ( wi?1, wi+1), suffix and digit information . It is noted that when wi?2, wi+2 and prefix information are added with the best feature , the fvalue is reduced to 72.65.
From the above discussion it is clear that the system suffers from overfitting if a large number of features are used to train the system . Note that the surrounding word ( wi?2, wi?1, wi+1, wi+2 etc .) features can take any value from the lexicon and hence are of high dimensionality . These cause the degradation of performance of the system . However it is obvious that few words in the lexicon are important in identification of NEs.
To solve the problem of high dimensionality we use clustering to group the words present in the corpus into much smaller number of clusters . Then the word clusters are used as features instead of the word features ( for surrounding words ). For example , our Hindi corpus contains 17,456 different words , which are grouped into N ( say 100) clusters.
Then for a particular word , it is assigned to a cluster and the corresponding cluster-id is used as feature.
Hence the number of features is reduced to 100 instead of 17,456.
Similarly , selection of important words can also solve the problem of high dimensionality . As some of the words in the lexicon play important role in the NE identification process , we aim to select these particular words . Only these important words are used in NE identification instead of all words in the corpus.
3 Word Clustering
Clustering is the process of grouping together objects based on their similarity . The measure of similarity is critical for good quality clustering . We have experimented with some approaches to compute wordword similarity . These are described in details in the following section.
491 3.1 Cosine Similarity based on Sentence Level
Cooccurrence
A word is represented by a binary vector of dimension same as the number of sentences in the corpus . A component of the vector is 1 if the word occurs in the corresponding sentence and zero otherwise . Then we measure cosine similarity between the word vectors . The cosine similarity between two word vectors ( ~ A and ~ B ) with dimension d is measured as:
CosSim ( ~ A , ~ B ) = ? dAdBd ( ? dA ? dB (3) This measures the number of cooccurring sentences.
3.2 Cosine Similarity based on Proximal
Words
In this measure a word is represented by a vector having dimension same as the lexicon size . For ease of implementation we have taken a dimension of 2 ? 200, where each component of the vector corresponds to one of the 200 most frequent preceding and following words of a token word.
List Prev containing the most frequent ( top 200) previous words ( wi?1 or wi?2 if wi is the first word of a NE ) and List Next contains 200 most frequent next words ( wi+1 or wi+2 if wi is the last word of a NE ). A particular word wk may occur several times ( say n ) in the corpus . For each occurrence of wk find if its previous word ( wk?1 or wk?2) matches any element of List Prev . If matches , then set 1 to the corresponding position of the vector and set zero to all other positions related to List Prev . Similarly check the next word ( wk+1 or wk+2) in the List Next and find the values of the corresponding positions . The final word vector ~ Wk is obtained by taking the average of all occurrences of wk . Then the cosine similarity is measured between the word vectors . This measures the similarity of the contexts of the occurrences of the word in terms of the proximal words.
3.3 Similarity based on Proximity to NE
Categories
Here , for each word ( wi ) in the corpus four binary vectors are defined corresponding to two preceding and two following positions ( i1, i2, i+1, i+2). Each binary vector is of dimension five corresponding to four NE classes ( Cj ) and one for the notname class . For a particular word wk , find all the words occur in a particular position ( say , +1). Measure the fraction ( Pj(wk )) of these words belonging to a class Cj . The component of the word vector ~ Wk for the position corresponding to Cj is Pj(wk).
Pj(wk ) =
No . of times wk+1 is a NE of class Cj
Total occurrence of wk in corpus
The Euclidean distance is used to find the similarity between the above word vectors as a similarity measure . Some of the word vectors for the +1 position are given in Table 3. In this table we have given the word vectors for a few Hindi words , which are , sthita ( located ), shahara ( city ), jAkara ( go ), nagara ( township ), gA.nva ( village ), nivAsI ( resident ), mishrA ( a surname ) and limiTeDa ( ltd .). From the table we observe that the word vectors are close for sthita [0 0.478 0 0 0.522], shahara [0 0.585 0.001 0.024 0.39], nagara [0 0.507 0.019 0 0.474] and gA.nva [0 0.551 0 0 0.449]. So these words are considered as close.
Word Per Loc Org Dat Not sthita 0 0.478 0 0 0.522 shahara 0 0.585 0.001 0.024 0.39 jAkara 0 0.22 0 0 0.88 nagara 0 0.507 0.019 0 0.474 gA.nva 0 0.551 0 0 0.449 nivAsI 0.108 0.622 0 0 0.27 mishrA 0.889 0 0 0 0.111 limiTeDa 0 0 1 0 0 Table 3: Example of some word vectors for next (+1) position ( see text for glosses ) 3.4 Kmeans Clustering Using the above similarity measures we have used the kmeans algorithm . The seeds were randomly selected . The value of k ( number of clusters ) was varied till the best result is obtained.
4 Important Word Selection
It is noted that not all words are equally important in determining the NE category . Some of the words ular NE category and hence have important role to play in the classification process . We describe below a few statistical techniques that has been used to identify the important words.
4.1 Class Independent Important Word
Selection
We define context words as those which occur in proximity of a NE . In other words , context words are the words present in the wi?2, wi?1, wi+1 or wi+2 position if wi is a NE . Note that only a subset of the lexicon are context words . For all the context words , its N weight is calculated as the ratio between the occurrence of the word as a context word and its total number of occurrence in the corpus . The context words having the higher N weight are considered as important words for NER . For our experiments we have considered top 500 words as important words.
N weight(wi ) =
Occurrence of wi as context word
Total occurrence of wi in corpus 4.2 Important Words for Each Class Similar to the class independent important word selection from the contexts , important words are selected for individual classes also . This is an extension of the previous context word considering only NEs of a particular class . For person , location , organization and date classes we have considered top 150, 120, 50 and 50 words respectively as important words . Four binary features are also defined for these four classes . These are defined as having value 1 if any of the context words belongs to the important words list for a particular class.
4.3 Important Words for Each Position
Position based important words are also selected from the corpus . Here instead of context , particular positions are considered . Four lists are compiled for two preceding and two following positions (-2, -1, +1 and +2).
5 Evaluation of NE Recognition
The following subsections contain the experimental results using word clustering and important word selection . The results demonstrate the effectiveness of k Per Loc Org Dat Total 20 66.33 74.57 43.64 91.30 69.54 50 64.13 76.35 52 93.62 71.7 80 66.33 74.57 53.85 93.62 72.08 100 70.1 73.1 57.7 96.62 72.78 120 66.15 73.43 54.9 93.62 71.52 150 66.88 74.94 53.06 95.65 72.33 200 66.09 73.82 52 92 71.13 Table 4: Variation of MaxEnt based system accuracy depending on number of clusters ( k ) word clustering and important word selection over the baseline MaxEnt model.
5.1 Using Word Clusters
To evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering approaches in Hindi NER , we have used cluster features instead of word features . For the surrounding words , corresponding cluster-ids are used as feature.
Choice of k : We have already mentioned that , for kmeans clustering number of classes ( k ) should be determined initially . To find suitable k we had conducted the following experiments . We have selected a feature F1 ( mentioned in Table 2) and applied the clusters with different k as features replacing the word features . In Table 4 we have summarized the experimental results , in order to find a suitable k for clustering , the word vectors obtained using the procedure described in Section 3.3. From the table we observe that the best result is obtained when k is 100. We have used k = 100 for the subsequent experiments for comparing the effectiveness of the features . Similarly when we deal with all the words in the corpus (17,465 words ), we got best results when the words are clustered into 1100 clusters . ? The details of the comparison between the baseline word features and the reduced features obtained using clustering are given in Table 5. In general it is observed that clustering has improved the performance over baseline features . Using only cluster features the system provides a maximum fvalue of 74.26 where the corresponding word features give fvalue of 69.09.
Among the various similarity measures of clustering , improved results are obtained using the clus-

Section 3.3).
Using clustering features the best fvalue (79.03) is obtained using clusters for previous two and next two words along with the suffix , prefix , digit and
POS information.
It is observed that the prefix information increases the accuracy if applied along with suffix information when cluster features are used . More interestingly , addition of cluster features for positions ?2 and +2 over the feature [ window(-1, +1), Suffix , Prefix , Digit , NomPSP ] increase the fvalue from 77.61 to 79.03. But in the baseline system addition of word features ( wi?2 and wi+2) over the same feature decrease the fvalue from 75.6 to 72.65.
5.2 Using Important Word Selection
The details of the comparison between the word feature and the reduced features based on important word selection are given in Table 6. For the surrounding word features , find whether the particular word ( e.g . at position -1, -2 etc .) presents in the important words list ( corresponding to the particular position if position based important words are considered ). If the word occurs in the list then the word is used as features . In general it is observed that word selection also improves performance over baseline features . Among the different approaches , the best result is obtained when important words for two preceding and two following positions ( defined in Section 4.3) are selected . Using important word based features , the highest fvalue of 79.85 is obtained by using the important words for previous two and next two positions along with the suffix , prefix , digit and POS information.
5.3 Relative Effectiveness of Clustering and
Word Selection
In most of the cases clustering based features perform better then the important word based feature reduction . But the best fvalue (79.85) of the system ( using the clustering based and important word based features separately ) is obtained by using important word based features.
Next we have made an experiment by considering both the clusters and important words combined.
We have defined the combined feature as , if the word ( wi ) is in the corresponding important word list then the word is used as feature otherwise the corresponding cluster-id ( in which wi belongs to ) is considered as feature . Using the combined feature , we have achieved further improvement . Here we are able to achieve the highest fvalue of 80.01.

Note that our clustering approach is different , where the clusters are obtained using some statistics derived from the annotated corpus , and also the purpose is different as we have used the clusters for feature reduction.
In this paper we propose two feature reduction techniques for Hindi NER based on word clustering and word selection . A number of word similarity measures are used for clustering . A few statistical approaches are used for the selection of important words . It is observed that significant enhancement of accuracy over the baseline system which use word features is obtained . This is probably due to reduction of overfitting . This is more important for a resource poor languages like Hindi where there is scarcity in annotated training data and other NER resources ( like , gazetteer lists).
