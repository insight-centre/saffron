Abstract
There is a widely held belief in the natural language and computational linguistics communities that Semantic Role Labeling ( SRL ) is a significant step toward improving important applications , e.g . question answering and information extraction . In this paper , we present an SRL system for Modern Standard Arabic that exploits many aspects of the rich morphological features of the language . The experiments on the pilot Arabic Propbank data show that our system based on Support Vector Machines and Kernel Methods yields a global SRL F1 score of 82.17%, which improves the current state-of-the-art in Arabic SRL.
1 Introduction
Shallow approaches to semantic processing are making large strides in the direction of efficiently and effectively deriving tacit semantic information from text . Semantic Role Labeling ( SRL ) is one such approach . With the advent of faster and more powerful computers , more effective machine learning algorithms , and importantly , large data resources annotated with relevant levels of semantic information , such as the FrameNet ( Baker et al , 1998) and ProbBank ( Kingsbury and Palmer , 2003), we are seeing a surge in efficient approaches to SRL ( Carreras and
Ma`rquez , 2005).
SRL is the process by which predicates and their arguments are identified and their roles are defined in a sentence . For example , in the English sentence , ? John likes apples .?, the predicate is ? likes ? whereas ? John ? and ? apples ?, bear the semantic role labels agent ( ARG0) and theme ( ARG1). The crucial fact about semantic roles is that regardless of the overt syntactic structure variation , the underlying predicates remain the same . Hence , for the sentence ? John opened the door ? and ? the door opened ?, though ? the door ? is the object of the first sentence and the subject of the second , it is the ? theme ? in both sentences . Same idea applies to passive constructions , for example.
There is a widely held belief in the NLP and computational linguistics communities that identifying and defining roles of predicate arguments in a sentence has a lot of potential for and is a significant step toward improving important applications such as document retrieval , machine translation , question answering and information extraction ( Moschitti et al ., 2007).
To date , most of the reported SRL systems are for English , and most of the data resources exist for English . We do see some headway for other languages such as German and Chinese ( Erk and Pado , 2006; Sun and Jurafsky , 2004). The systems for the other languages follow the successful models devised for English , e.g . ( Gildea and Jurafsky , 2002; Gildea and Palmer , 2002; Chen and Rambow , 2003; Thompson et al , 2003; Pradhan et al , 2003; Moschitti , 2004; Xue and Palmer , 2004; Haghighi et al , 2005). In the same spirit and facilitated by the release of the SemEval 2007 Task 18 data1, based on the Pilot Arabic Propbank , a preliminary SRL system exists for Ara-bic2 ( Diab and Moschitti , 2007; Diab et al , 2007a).
However , it did not exploit some special characteristics of the Arabic language on the SRL task.
In this paper , we present an SRL system for MSA that exploits many aspects of the rich morphological features of the language . It is based on a supervised model that uses support vector machines ( SVM ) technology ( Vapnik , 1998) for argument boundary detection and argument classification . It is trained and tested using the pilot Arabic Propbank data released as part of the SemEval 2007 data . Given the lack of a reliable Arabic deep syntactic parser , we 1http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval / 2We use Arabic to refer to Modern Standard Arabic ( MSA).

This paper is laid out as follows : Section 2 presents facts about the Arabic language especially in relevant contrast to English ; Section 3 presents the approach and system adopted for this work ; Section 4 presents the experimental setup , results and discussion . Finally , Section 5 draws our conclusions.
2 Arabic Language and Impact on SRL
Arabic is a very different language from English in several respects relevant to the SRL task . Arabic is a semitic language . It is known for its templatic morphology where words are made up of roots and affixes . Clitics agglutinate to words . Clitics include prepositions , conjunctions , and pronouns.
In contrast to English , Arabic exhibits rich morphology . Similar to English , Arabic verbs explicitly encode tense , voice , Number , and Person features . Additionally , Arabic encodes verbs with Gender , Mood ( subjunctive , indicative and jussive ) information . For nominals ( nouns , adjectives , proper names ), Arabic encodes syntactic Case ( accusative , genitive and nominative ), Number , Gender and Definiteness features . In general , many of the morphological features of the language are expressed via short vowels also known as diacritics3 .
Unlike English , syntactically Arabic is a prodrop language , where the subject of a verb may be implicitly encoded in the verb morphology . Hence , we observe sentences such as ? A?KQ . ? @ ?? @ Akl AlbrtqAl ? ate-[he ] the-oranges ?, where the verb Akl encodes the third Person Masculine Singular subject in the verbal morphology . It is worth noting that in the ATB 35% of all sentences are pro-dropped for subject ( Maamouri et al , 2006). Unless the syntactic parse is very accurate in identifying the pro-dropped case , identifying the syntactic subject and the underlying semantic arguments are a challenge for such prodrop cases.
Arabic syntax exhibits relative free word order.
Arabic allows for both subject-verb-object ( SVO ) and verb-subject-object ( VSO ) argument orders.4 In 3Diacritics encode the vocalic structure , namely the short vowels , as well as the gemmination marker for consonantal doubling , among other markers.
4MSA less often allows for OSV , or OVS.
the VSO constructions , the verb agrees with the syntactic subject in Gender only , while in the SVO constructions , the verb agrees with the subject in both Number and Gender . Even though , in the ATB , an equal distribution of both VSO and SVO is observed ( each appearing 30% of the time ), it is known that in general Arabic is predominantly in VSO order.
Moreover , the prodrop cases could effectively be perceived as VSO orders for the purposes of SRL.
Syntactic Case is very important in the cases of VSO and prodrop constructions as they indicate the syntactic roles of the object arguments with accusative Case . Unless the morphology of syntactic Case is explicitly present , such free word order could run the SRL system into significant confusion for many of the predicates where both arguments are semantically of the same type.
Arabic exhibits more complex noun phrases than English mainly to express possession . These constructions are known as idafa constructions . Modern standard Arabic does not have a special particle expressing possession . In these complex structures a surface indefinite noun ( missing an explicit definite article ) may be followed by a definite noun marked with genitive Case , rendering the first noun syntactically definite . For example ,  I
J . ? @ ? g . P rjl
Albyt ? man the-house ? meaning ? man of the house ?, ? g . P becomes definite . An adjective modifying the noun ? g . P will have to agree with it in Number , Gender , Definiteness , and Case . However , without explicit morphological encoding of these agreements , the scope of the arguments would be confusing to an SRL system . In a sentence such as ? K ???@  I  J . ? @ ? g . P rjlu Albyti AlTwylu meaning ? the tall man of the house ?: ? man ? is definite , masculine , singular , nominative , corresponding to Definiteness , Gender , Number and Case , respectively ; ? the-house ? is definite , masculine , singular , genitive ; ? the-tall ? is definite , masculine , singular , nominative . We note that ? man ? and ? tall ? agree in Number , Gender , Case and Definiteness . Syntactic Case is marked using short vowels u , and i at the end of the word . Hence , rjlu and AlTwylu agree in their Case ending5 Without the explicit marking of the Case information , 5The presence of the Albyti is crucial as it renders rjlu definite therefore allowing the agreement with AlTwylu to be complete.

Figure 1: Annotated Arabic Tree corresponding to ? Chinese Prime minister Zhu Rongjy started an official visit to India last Sunday .? namely in the word endings , it could be equally valid that ? the-tall ? modifies ? the-house ? since they agree in Number , Gender and Definiteness as explicitly marked by the Definiteness article Al . Hence , these idafa constructions could be tricky for SRL in the absence of explicit morphological features . This is compounded by the general absence of short vowels , expressed by diacritics ( i.e . the u and i in rjlu and Albyti ,) in naturally occurring text . Idafa constructions in the ATB exhibit recursive structure , embedding other NPs , compared to English where possession is annotated with flat NPs and is designated by a possessive marker.
Arabic texts are underspecified for diacritics to different degrees depending on the genre of the text ( Diab et al , 2007b ). Such an underspecification of diacritics masks some of the very relevant morphosyntactic interactions between the different categories such as agreement between nominals and their modifiers as exemplified before , or verbs and their subjects.
Having highlighted the differences , we hypothesize that the interaction between the rich morphology ( if explicitly marked and present ) and syntax could help with the SRL task . The presence of explicit Number and Gender agreement as well as Case information aids with identification of the syntactic subject and object even if the word order is relatively free . Gender , Number , Definiteness and Case agreement between nouns and their modifiers and other nominals , should give clues to the scope of arguments as well as their classes . The presence of such morphosyntactic information should lead to better argument boundary detection and better classification.

The previous section suggests that an optimal model should take into account specific characteristics of

Arabic . In this research , we go beyond the previously proposed basic SRL system for Arabic ( Diab et al , 2007a ; Diab and Moschitti , 2007). We exploit the full morphological potential of the language to verify our hypothesis that taking advantage of the interaction between morphology and syntax can improve on a basic SRL system for morphologically rich languages.
Similar to the previous Arabic SRL systems , our adopted SRL models use Support Vector Machines to implement a two step classification approach , i.e . boundary detection and argument classification . Such models have already been investigated in ( Pradhan et al , 2005; Moschitti et al , 2005). The two step classification description is as follows.
3.1 Predicate Argument Extraction
The extraction of predicative structures is based on the sentence level . Given a sentence , its predicates , as indicated by verbs , have to be identified along with their arguments . This problem is usually divided in two subtasks : ( a ) the detection of the target argument boundaries , i.e . the span of the argument words in the sentence , and ( b ) the classification of the argument type , e.g . Arg0 or ArgM for Propbank

or Agent and Goal for the FrameNet.
The standard approach to learn both the detection and the classification of predicate arguments is summarized by the following steps : ( a ) Given a sentence from the trainingset , generate a full syntactic parsetree ; ( b ) let P and A be the set of predicates and the set of parsetree nodes ( i.e . the potential arguments ), respectively ; ( c ) for each pair ? p , a ? ? P ? A : extract the feature representation set , Fp,a and put it in T + ( positive examples ) if the subtree rooted in a covers exactly the words of one argument of p , otherwise put it in T ? ( negative examples).
For instance , in Figure 1, for each combination of the predicate started with the nodes NP , S , VP , VPD , NNP , NN , PP , JJ or IN the instances Fstarted,a are generated . In case the node a exactly covers ? president ministers Chinese Zhu Rongji ? or ? visit official to India ?, Fp,a will be a positive instance otherwise it will be a negative one , e.g . Fstarted,IN .
The T + and T ? sets are used to train the boundary classifier . To train the multiclass classifier , T + can be reorganized as positive T+argi and negative T?argi examples for each argument i . This way , an individual ONE-vs-ALL classifier for each argument i can be trained . We adopt this solution , according to ( Pradhan et al , 2005), since it is simple and effective . In the classification phase , given an unseen sentence , all its Fp,a are generated and classified by each individual classifier Ci . The argument associated with the maximum among the scores provided by the individual classifiers is eventually selected.
The above approach assigns labels independently , without considering the whole predicate argument structure . As a consequence , the classifier output may generate overlapping arguments . Thus , to make the annotations globally consistent , we apply a disambiguating heuristic adopted from ( Diab and Moschitti , 2007) that selects only one argument among multiple overlapping arguments.
3.2 Features
The discovery of relevant features is , as usual , a complex task . The choice of features is further compounded for a language such as Arabic given its rich morphology and morphosyntactic interactions.
To date , there is a common consensus on the set of basic standard features for SRL , which we will refer to as standard . The set of standard features , refers to unstructured information derived from parse trees.
e.g . Phrase Type , Predicate Word or Head Word.
Typically the standard features are language independent . In our experiments we employ the features listed in Table 1, defined in ( Gildea and Jurafsky , 2002; Pradhan et al , 2005; Xue and Palmer , 2004).
For example , the Phrase Type indicates the syntactic type of the phrase labeled as a predicate argument , e.g . NP for ARG1 in Figure 1. The Parse Tree Path contains the path in the parse tree between the predicate and the argument phrase , expressed as a sequence of nonterminal labels linked by direction ( up or down ) symbols , e.g . VBD ? VP ? NP for ARG1 in Figure 1. The Predicate Word is the surface form of the verbal predicate , e.g . started for all arguments . The standard features , as successful as they are , are designed primarily for English . They are not exploiting the different characteristics of the Arabic language as expressed through morphology . Hence , we explicitly encode new SRL features that capture the richness of Arabic morphology and its role in morphosyntactic behavior . The set of morphological attributes include : inflectional morphology such as Number , Gender , Definiteness , Mood , Case , Person ; derivational morphology such as the Lemma form of the words with all the diacritics explicitly marked ; vowelized and fully diacritized form of the surface form ; the English gloss6. It is worth noting that there exists highly accurate morphological taggers for Arabic such as the MADA system ( Habash and Rambow , 2005; Roth et al , 2008). MADA tags 6The gloss is not sense disambiguated , hence they include homonyms.

modern standard Arabic with all the relevant morphological features as well as it produces highly accurate lemma and gloss information by tapping into an underlying morphological lexicon . A list of the extended features is described in Table 2.
The set of possible features and their combinations are very large leading to an intractable feature selection problem . Therefore , we exploit well known kernel methods , namely tree kernels , to robustly experiment with all the features simultaneously . Such kernel engineering , as shown in ( Moschitti , 2004), allows us to experiment with many syntactic/semantic features seamlessly.
3.3 Engineering Arabic Features with Kernel
Methods
Feature engineering via kernel methods is a useful technique that allows us to save a lot of time in the design and implementation of features . The basic idea is ( a ) to design a set of basic value-attribute features and apply polynomial kernels and generate all possible combinations ; or ( b ) to design basic tree structures expressing properties related to the target linguistic objects and use tree kernels to generate all possible tree subparts , which will constitute the feature representation vectors for the learning algorithm.
Tree kernels evaluate the similarity between two trees in terms of their overlap , generally measured as the number of common substructures ( Collins and Duffy , 2002). For example , Figure 2, shows a small parse tree and some of its fragments . To design a function which computes the number of common substructures between two trees t1 and t2, let us define the set of fragments F={f1, f2, ..} and the indicator function Ii(n ), equal to 1 if the target fi is rooted at node n and 0 otherwise . A tree kernel function KT (?) over two trees is defined as:

KT ( t1, t2) = ? n1?Nt1 ? n2?Nt2 ?( n1, n2), where Nt1 and Nt2 are the sets of nodes of t1 and t2, respectively . The function ?(?) evaluates the number of common fragments rooted in n1 and n2, i.e.
?(n1, n2) = ?| F | i=1 Ii(n1)Ii(n2). ? can be efficiently computed with the algorithm proposed in ( Collins and Duffy , 2002).
3.4 Structural Features for Arabic
In order to incorporate the characteristically rich Arabic morphology features structurally in the tree representations , we convert the features into value-attribute pairs at the leaf node level of the tree . Fig 1 illustrates the morphologically underspecified tree with some of the morphological features encoded in the POS tag such as VBD indicating past tense . This contrasts with Fig . 4 which shows an excerpt of the same tree encoding the chosen relevant morphological features.
For the sake of classification , we will be dealing with two kinds of structures : the Argument Structure Tree ( AST ) ( Pighin and Basili , 2006) and the Extended Argument Structure Tree ( EAST ). The AST is defined as the minimal subtree encompassing all and only the leaf nodes encoding words belonging to the predicate or one of its arguments . An AST example is shown in Figure 3. The EAST is the corresponding structure in which all the leaf nodes have been extended with the ten morphological fea-

tures described in Table 2, forming a vector of 10 preterminal-terminal node pairs that replace the surface of the leaf . The resulting EAST structure is shown in Figure 4.
Not all the features are instantiated for all the leaf node words . Due to space limitations , in the figure we did not include the Features that have NULL values . For instance , Definiteness is always associated with nominals , hence the verb  @ YK . bd ? ? start ? is assigned a NULL value for the Definite feature.
Verbs exhibit Gender information depending on inflections . For our example ,  @ YK . ? started ? is inflected for masculine Gender , singular Number , third person . On the other hand , the noun Z @ P P ??@ is definite and is assigned genitive Case since it is in a possessive , idafa , construction.
The features encoded by the EAST can provide very useful hints for boundary and role classification . Considering Figure 1, argument boundaries is not as straight forward to identify as there are several NPs . Assuming that the inner most NP ? ministers the-Chinese ? is a valid Argument could potentially be accepted . There is ample evidence that any NN followed by a JJ would make a perfectly valid Argument . However , an AST structure would mask the fact that the JJ ? the-Chinese ? does not modify the NN ? ministers ? since they do not agree in Number7, and in syntactic Case , where the latter is genitive and the former is nominative . ? the-Chinese ? in fact modifies ? president ? as they agree on all the underlying morphological features . Conversely , the EAST in Figure 4 explicitly encodes this agreement including an agreement on Definiteness . It is worth noting that just observing the Arabic word ? KP ? president ? in Fig 1, the system would assume that it is an indefinite word since it does not include the definite arti-7The POS tag on this node is NN as broken plural , however , the underlying morphological feature Number is plural.
cle ?@. Therefore , the system could be lead astray to conclude that ? the-Chinese ? does not modify ? president ? but rather ? the-ministers ?. Without knowing the Case information and the agreement features between the verb  @ YK . ? started ? and the two nouns heading the two main NPs in our tree , the syntactic subject can be either ? PAK P ? visit ? or ? KP ? president ? in Figure 1. The EAST is more effective in identifying the first noun as the syntactic subject and the second as the object since the morphological information indicates that they are in nominative and accusative Case , respectively . Also the agreement in Gender and Number between the verb and the syntactic subject is identified in the enriched tree . We see that @ YK.
?started ? and ? KP ? president ? agree in being singular and masculine . If ? PAK P ? visit ? were the syntactic subject , we would have seen the verb inflected as  H @ YK . ? started-FEM ? with a feminine inflection to reflect the verb-subject agreement on Gender . Hence these agreement features should help with the classification task.
4 Experiments
In these experiments we investigate ( a ) if the technology proposed in previous work for automatic SRL of English texts is suitable for Arabic SRL systems , and ( b ) the impact of tree kernels using new tree structures on Arabic SRL . For this purpose , we test our models on the two individual phases of the traditional 2stage SRL model ( i.e . boundary detection and argument classification ) and on the complete SRL task . We use three different feature spaces : a set of standard attribute-value features and the AST and the EAST structures defined in 3.4. Standard feature vectors can be combined with a polynomial kernel ( Poly ), which , when the degree is larger than 1, automatically generates feature conjunctions . This , as suggested in ( Pradhan et al , 2005; Moschitti , 2004), can help stressing the differ-tures can be used in the learning algorithm thanks to the tree kernels described in Section 3.3. Moreover , to verify if the above feature sets are equivalent or complementary , we can join them by means of additive operation which always produces a valid kernel ( ShaweTaylor and Cristianini , 2004).
4.1 Experimental setup
We use the dataset released in the SemEval 2007 Task 18 on Arabic Semantic Labeling ( Diab et al , 2007a ). The data covers the 95 most frequent verbs in the Arabic Treebank III ver . 2 ( ATB).
The ATB consists of MSA newswire data from the Annhar newspaper , spanning the months from July to November , 2002. All our experiments are carried out with gold standard trees.
An important characteristic of the dataset is the use of unvowelized Arabic in the Buckwalter transliteration scheme for deriving the basic features for the AST experimental condition . The data comprises a development set , a test set and a training set of 886, 902 and 8,402 sentences , respectively , where each set contain 1725, 1661 and 21,194 argument instances . These instances are distributed over 26 different role types . The training instances of the boundary detection task also include parsetree nodes that do not correspond to correct boundaries ( we only considered 350K examples ). For the experiments , we use SVM-Light-TK toolkit8 ( Moschitti , 2004; Moschitti , 2006) and its SVMLight default parameters . The system performance , i.e . F1 on single boundary and role classifier , accuracy of the role multiclassifier and the F1 of the complete SRL systems , are computed by means of the CoNLL evalua-tor9.
4.2 Results
Figure 5 reports the F1 of the SVM boundary classifier using Polynomial Kernels with a degree from 1 to 6 ( i.e . Polyi ), the AST and the EAST kernels and their combinations . We note that as we introduce conjunctions , i.e . a degree larger than 2, the F1 increases by more than 3 percentage points . Thus , not only are the English features meaningful for Arabic but also their combinations are important , reveal-8http://disi.unitn.it/?moschitti 9http://www.lsi.upc.es/?srlconll/soft.html Figure 5: Impact of polynomial kernel , tree kernels and their combinations on boundary detection.
Figure 6: Impact of the polynomial kernel , tree kernels and their combinations on the accuracy in role classification ( gold boundaries ) and on the F1 of complete SRL task ( boundary + role classification).
ing that both languages share an underlying syntax-semantics interface . Moreover , we note that the F1 of EAST is higher than the F1 of AST which in turn is higher than the linear kernel ( Poly1). However , when conjunctive features ( Poly2-4) are used the system accuracy exceeds those of tree kernel models alone . Further increasing the polynomial degree ( Poly5-6) generates very complex hypotheses which result in very low accuracy values.
Therefore , to improve the polynomial kernel , we sum it to the contribution of AST and/or EAST , obtaining AST+Poly3 ( polynomial kernel of degree 3), EAST+Poly3 and AST+EAST+Poly3, whose F1 scores are also shown in Figure 5. Such combined models improve on the best polynomial kernel . However , not much difference is shown between AST and EAST on boundary detection . This is expected since we are using gold standard trees.
We hypothesize that the rich morphological features will help more with the role classification task . Therefore , we evaluate role classification with gold boundaries . The curve labeled ? classification ? in Figure 6 illustrates the accuracy of the SVM role multiclassifier according to different kernels.

Table 3: F1 of different models on the Arabic SRL task.
Again , we note that a degree larger than 1 yields a significant improvement of more than 3 percent points , suggesting that the design of Arabic SRL system based on SVMs requires polynomial kernels.
In contrast to the boundary results , EAST highly improves over AST ( by about 3 percentage points ) and produces an F1 comparable to the best Polynomial kernel . Moreover , AST+Poly3, EAST+Poly3 and AST+EAST+Poly3 all yield different degrees of improvement , where the latter model is both the richest in terms of features and the most accurate.
These results strongly suggest that : ( a ) tree kernels generate new syntactic features that are useful for the classification of Arabic semantic roles ; ( b ) the richer morphology of Arabic language should be exploited effectively to obtain accurate SRL systems ; ( c ) tree kernels appears to be a viable approach to effectively achieve this goal.
To illustrate the practical feasibility of our system , we investigate the complete SRL task where both the boundary detection and argument role classification are performed automatically . The curve labeled ? boundary + role classification ? in Figure 6 reports the F1 of SRL systems based on the previous kernels . The trend of the plot is similar to the goldstandard boundaries case . The difference among the F1 scores of the AST+Poly3, EAST+Poly3 and AST+EAST+Poly3 is slightly reduced . This may be attributed to the fact that they produce similar boundary detection results , which in turn , for the global SRL outcome , are summed to those of the classification phase . Table 3 details the differences among the models and shows that the best model improves the SRL system based on the polynomial kernel , i.e . the SRL state-of-the-art for Arabic , by about 2 percentage points . This is a very large improvement for SRL systems ( Carreras and Ma`rquez , 2005). These results confirm that the new enriched structures along with tree kernels are a promising approach for Arabic SRL systems.
Finally , Table 4 reports the F1 of the best model , AST+EAST+Poly3, for individual arguments in the

SRL task . We note that , as for English SRL , ARG0 shows high values (96.70%). Conversely , ARG1 seems more difficult to be classified in Arabic . The F1 for ARG1 is only 90.57% compared with 96.70% for ARG0.
This may be attributed to the different possible syntactic orders of Arabic consructions confusing the syntactic subject with the object especially where there is no clear morphological features on the arguments to decide either way.
5 Conclusions
We have presented a model for Arabic SRL that yields a global SRL F1 score of 82.17% by combining rich structured features and traditional attribute-value features derived from English SRL systems.
The resulting system significantly improves previously reported results on the same task and dataset.
This outcome is very promising given that the available data is small compared to the English data sets.
For future work , we would like to explore further explicit morphological features such as aspect tense and voice as well as richer POS tag sets such as those proposed in ( Diab , 2007). Finally , we would like to experiment with automatic parses and different syntactic formalisms such as dependencies and shallow parses.
