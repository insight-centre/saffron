Abstract
We show that using confidence-weighted classification in transition-based parsing gives results comparable to using SVMs with faster training and parsing time . We also compare with other online learning algorithms and investigate the effect of pruning features when using confidence-weighted classification.
1 Introduction
There has been a lot of work on datadriven dependency parsing . The two dominating approaches have been graphbased parsing , e.g . MST-parsing ( McDonald et al , 2005b ) and transition-based parsing , e.g . the MaltParser ( Nivre et al , 2006a).
These two approaches differ radically but have in common that the best results have been obtained using margin-based machine learning approaches . For the MST-parsing MIRA ( McDonald et al , 2005a ; McDonald and Pereira , 2006) and for transition-based parsing Support-Vector Machines ( Hall et al , 2006; Nivre et al , 2006b).
Dredze et al (2008) introduce a new approach to margin-based online learning called confidence-weighted classification ( CW ) and show that the performance of this approach is comparable to that of Support-Vector Machines . In this work we use confidence-weighted classification with transition-based parsing and show that this leads to results comparable to the state-of-the-art results obtained using SVMs.
We also compare training time and the effect of pruning when using confidence-weighted learning.
2 Transition-based parsing
Transition-based parsing builds on the idea that parsing can be viewed as a sequence of transitions between states . A transition-based parser ( deterministic classifier-based parser ) consists of three essential components ( Nivre , 2008): 1. A parsing algorithm 2. A feature model 3. A classifier The focus here is on the classifier but we will briefly describe the parsing algorithm in order to understand the classification task better.
The parsing algorithm consists of two components , a transition system and an oracle.
Nivre (2008) defines a transition system S = ( C , T , c s , C t ) in the following way : 1. C is a set of configurations , each of which contains a buffer ? of ( remaining ) nodes and a set A of dependency arcs , 2. T is a set of transitions , each of which is a partial function t : C ? C , 3. c s is a initialization function mapping a sentence x = ( w n ) to a configuration with ? = [1, . . . , n ], 4. C t is a set of terminal configurations.
A transition sequence for a sentence x in S is a sequence C 0,m = ( c m ) of configurations , such that 1. c s ( x ), 2. c m ? C t , 3. for every i (1 ? i ? m)c i = t(c i?1 ) for some t ? T The oracle is used during training to determine a transition sequence that leads to the correct parse.
The job of the classifier is to ? imitate ? the oracle , i.e . to try to always pick the transitions that the classifier is the current configuration . Therefore the training data for the classifier consists of a number of configurations and the transitions the oracle chose with these configurations.
Here we focus on stack-based parsing algorithms . A stack-based configuration for a sentence x = ( w n ) is a triple c = (?, ?, A ), where 1. ? is a stack of tokens i ? k ( for some k ? n ), 2. ? is a buffer of tokens j > k , 3. A is a set of dependency arcs such that G = (0, 1, . . . , n , A ) is a dependency graph for x.
(Nivre , 2008)
In the work presented here we use the NivreEager algorithm which has four transitions : Shift Push the token at the head of the buffer onto the stack.
Reduce Pop the token on the top of the stack.
LeftArc l
Add to the analysis an arc with label l from the token at the head of the buffer to the token on the top of the stack , and push the buffer-token onto the stack.
RightArc l
Add to the analysis an arc with label l from the token on the top of the stack to the token at the head of the buffer , and pop the stack.
2.1 Classification
Transition-based dependency parsing reduces parsing to consecutive multiclass classification.
From each configuration one amongst some predefined number of transitions has to be chosen . This means that any classifier can be plugged into the system . The training instances are created by the oracle so the training is offline . So even though we use online learners in the experiments these are used in a batch setting.
The best results have been achieved using Support-Vector Machines placing the MaltParser very high in both the CoNNL shared tasks on dependency parsing in 2006 and 2007 ( Buchholz and Marsi , 2006; Nivre et al , 2007) and it has been shown that SVMs are better for the task than Memory-based learning ( Hall et al , 2006). The standard setting in the MaltParser is to use a 2nd-degree polynomial kernel with the SVM.
3 Confidence-weighted classification
Dredze et al (2008) introduce confidence-weighted linear classifiers which are online-classifiers that maintain a confidence parameter for each weight and uses this to control how to change the weights in each update . A problem with online algorithms is that because they have no memory of previously seen examples they do not know if a given weight has been updated many times or few times . If a weight has been updated many times the current estimation of the weight is probably relatively good and therefore should not be changed too much . On the other hand if it has never been updated before the estimation is probably very bad . CW classification deals with this by having a confidence-parameter for each weight , modeled by a Gaussian distribution , and this parameter is used to make more aggressive updates on weights with lower confidence ( Dredze et al , 2008). The classifiers also use Passive-Aggressive updates ( Crammer et al , 2006) to try to maximize the margin between positive and negative training instances.
CW classifiers are online-algorithms and are therefore fast to train , and it is not necessary to keep all training examples in memory . Despite this they perform as well or better than SVMs ( Dredze et al , 2008). Crammer et al (2009) extend the approach to multiclass classification and show that also in this setting the classifiers often outperform SVMs . They show that updating only the weights of the best of the wrongly classified classes yields the best results . We also use this approach , called top1, here.
Crammer et al (2008) present different update-rules for CW classification and show that the ones based on standard deviation rather than variance yield the best results . Our experiments have confirmed this , so in all experiments the update-rule from equation 10 ( Crammer et al , 2008) is used.
4 Experiments 4.1 Software
We use the opensource parser MaltParser all experiments . We have integrated confidence-weighted , perceptron and MIRA classifiers into the code . The code for the online classifiers has org papers.
4.2 Data
We have used the 10 smallest data sets from CoNNL-X ( Buchholz and Marsi , 2006) in our experiments . Evaluation has been done with the official evaluation script and evaluation data from this task.
4.3 Features
The standard setting for the MaltParser is to use SVMs with polynomial kernels , and because of this it uses a relatively small number of features.
In most of our experiments the default feature set of MaltParser consisting of 14 features has been used.
When using a linear-classifier without a kernel we need to extend the feature set in order to achieve good results . We have done this very uncritically by adding all pair wise combinations of all features . This leads to 91 additional features when using the standard 14 features.
5 Results and discussion
We will now discuss various results of our experiments with using CW-classifiers in transition-based parsing.
5.1 Online classifiers
We compare CW-classifiers with other online algorithms for linear classification . We compare with perceptron ( Rosenblatt , 1958) and MIRA ( Crammer et al , 2006). With both these classifiers we use the same top1 approach as with the CW-classifers and also averaging which has been shown to alleviate overfitting ( Collins , 2002). Table 2 shows Labeled Attachment Score obtained with the three online classifiers . All classifiers were trained with 10 iterations.
These results confirm those by Crammer et al (2009) and show that confidence-weighted classifiers are better than both perceptron and MIRA.
5.2 Training and parsing time
The training time of the CW-classifiers depends on the number of iterations used , and this of course affects the accuracy of the parser . Figure 1 shows Labeled Attachment Score as a function of the number of iterations used in training . The horizontal line shows the LAS obtained with SVM.

We see that after 4 iterations the CW-classifier has the best performance for the data set ( Danish ) used in this experiment . In most experiments we have used 10 iterations . Table 1 compares training time (10 iterations ) and parsing time of a parser using a CW-classifiers and a parser using SVM on the same data set . We see that training of the CW-classifier is faster , which is to be expected given their online-nature . We also see that parsing is much faster.

5.3 Pruning features
Because we explicitly represent pair wise combinations of all of the original features we get an extremely high number of binary features . For some of the larger data sets , the number of features is so big that we cannot hold the weightvector in memory . For instance the Czech dataset has 16 million binary features , and almost 800 classes - which means that in practice there are 12 billion binary features data sets from CoNNL-X.

Table 2: LAS on development data for three online classifers , CW-classifiers with manual feature selection and SVM . Statistical significance is measuered between CW-classifiers without feature selection and SVMs.
To solve this problem we have tried to use pruning to remove the features occurring fewest times in the training data . If a feature occurs fewer times than a given cutoff limit the feature is not included.
This goes against the idea of CW classifiers which are exactly developed so that rare features can be used . Experiments also show that this pruning hurts accuracy . Figure 2 shows the labeled attachment score as a function of the cutoff limit on the
Danish data.

5.4 Manual feature selection
Instead of pruning the features we tried manually removing some of the pair wise feature combinations . We removed some of the combinations that lead to the most extra features , which is especially the case with combinations of lexical features . In the extended default feature set for instance we removed all combinations of lexical features except the combination of the word form of the token at the top of the stack and of the word form of the token at the head of the buffer.
Table 2 shows that this consistently leads to a small decreases in LAS.
5.5 Results without optimization
Table 2 shows the results for the 10 CoNNL-X data sets used . For comparison we have included the results from using the standard classifier in the MaltParser , i.e . SVM with a polynomial kernel.
The hyperparameters for the SVM have not been optimized , and neither has the number of iterations for the CW-classifiers , which is always 10. We see that in many cases the CW-classifier does significantly is also the case.
5.6 Results with optimization
The results presented above are suboptimal for the SVMs because default parameters have been used for these , and optimizing these can improve ac-nificance is calculated using McNemar?s test ( p = 0.05).
These tests were made with MaltEval ( Nilsson and Nivre , 2008)

curacy a lot . In this section we will compare results obtained with CW-classifiers with the results for the MaltParser from CoNNL-X . In CoNNL-X both the hyper parameters for the SVMs and the features have been optimized . Here we do not do feature selection but use the features used by the
MaltParser in CoNNL-X
The only hyper parameter for CW classification is the number of iterations . We optimize this by doing 5-fold crossvalidation on the training data.
Although the manual feature selection has been shown to decrease accuracy this has been used for some languages to reduce the size of the model.
The results are presented in table 3.
We see that even though the feature set used are optimized for the SVMs there are not big differences between the parses that use SVMs and the parsers that use CW classification . In general though the parsers with SVMs does better than the parsers with CW classifiers and the difference seems to be biggest on the languages where we did manual feature selection.
6 Conclusion
We have shown that using confidence-weighted classifiers with transition-based dependency parsing yields results comparable with the state-of-the-art results achieved with Support Vector Machines - with faster training and parsing times . Currently we need a very high number of features to achieve these results , and we have shown that pruning this big feature set uncritically hurts performance of conllx / the confidence-weighted classifiers.
7 Future work
Currently the biggest challenge in the approach outlined here is the very high number of features needed to achieve good results . A possible solution is to use kernels with confidence-weighted classification in the same way they are used with the SVMs.
Another possibility is to extend the feature set in a more critical way than what is done now . For instance the combination of a POStag and CPOS-tag for a given word is now included . This feature does not convey any information that the POS-tag-feature itself does not . The same is the case for some wordform and word-lemma features . All in all a lot of noninformative features are added as things are now . We have not yet tried to use automatic features selection to select only the combinations that increase accuracy.
We will also try to do feature selection on a more general level as this can boost accuracy a lot.
The results in table 3 are obtained with the features optimized for the SVMs . These are not necessarily the optimal features for the CW-classifiers.
Another comparison we would like to do is with linear SVMs . Unlike the polynomial kernel SVMs used as default in the MaltParser linear SVMs can be trained in linear time ( Joachims , 2006). Trying to use the same extended feature set we use with the CW-classifiers with a linear SVM would provide an interesting comparison.
