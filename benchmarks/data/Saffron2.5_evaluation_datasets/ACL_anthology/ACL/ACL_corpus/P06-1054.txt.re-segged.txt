Abstract
We present a novel classifier-based deterministic parser for Chinese constituency parsing . Our parser computes parse trees from bottom up in one pass , and uses classifiers to make shift-reduce decisions.
Trained and evaluated on the standard training and test sets , our best model ( using stacked classifiers ) runs in linear time and has labeled precision and recall above 88% using goldstandard part-of-speech tags , surpassing the best published results . Our SVM parser is 213 times faster than state-of-the-art parsers , while producing more accurate results . Our Maxent and DTree parsers run at speeds 40-270 times faster than state-of-the-art parsers , but with 56% losses in accuracy.
1 Introduction and Background
Syntactic parsing is one of the most fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ). In recent years , Chinese syntactic parsing has also received a lot of attention in the NLP community , especially since the release of large collections of annotated data such as the Penn Chinese Treebank ( Xue et al , 2005). Corpusbased parsing techniques that are successful for English have been applied extensively to Chinese . Traditional statistical approaches build models which assign probabilities to every possible parse tree for a sentence . Techniques such as dynamic programming , beamsearch , and best-first-search are then employed to find the parse tree with the highest probability . The massively ambiguous nature of wide-coverage statistical parsing,coupled with cubic-time ( or worse ) algorithms makes this approach too slow for many practical applications.
Deterministic parsing has emerged as an attractive alternative to probabilistic parsing , offering accuracy just below the state-of-the-art in syntactic analysis of English , but running in linear time ( Sagae and Lavie , 2005; Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003; Nivre and Scholz , 2004). Encouraging results have also been shown recently by Cheng et al (2004; 2005) in applying deterministic models to Chinese dependency parsing.
We present a novel classifier-based deterministic parser for Chinese constituency parsing . In our approach , which is based on the shift-reduce parser for English reported in ( Sagae and Lavie , 2005), the parsing task is transformed into a succession of classification tasks . The parser makes one pass through the input sentence . At each parse state , it consults a classifier to make shift/reduce decisions . The parser then commits to a decision and enters the next parse state . Shift/reduce decisions are made deterministically based on the local context of each parse state , and no backtracking is involved . This process can be viewed as a greedy search where only one path in the whole search space is considered . Our parser produces both dependency and constituent structures , but in this paper we will focus on constituent parsing.
By separating the classification task from the parsing process , we can take advantage of many machine learning techniques such as classifier ensemble . We conducted experiments with four different classifiers : support vector machines ( SVM ), MaximumEntropy ( Maxent ), Decision Tree ( DTree ) and memory-based learning ( MBL).
We also compared the performance of three different classifier ensemble approaches ( simple voting , classifier stacking and metaclassifier).
Our best model ( using stacked classifiers ) runs in linear time and has labeled precision and recall above 88% using goldstandard part-of-speech tags , surpassing the best published results ( see Section 5). Our SVM parser is 213 times faster than state-of-the-art parsers , while produc-parsers are 40-270 times faster than state-of-the-art parsers , but with 56% losses in accuracy.
2 Deterministic parsing model
Like other deterministic parsers , our parser assumes input has already been segmented and tagged with part-of-speech ( POS ) information during a preprocessing step1. The main data structures used in the parsing algorithm are a queue and a stack . The input word-POS pairs to be processed are stored in the queue . The stack holds the partial parse trees that are built during parsing . A parse state is represented by the content of the stack and queue.
The classifier makes shift/reduce decisions based on contextual features that represent the parse state . A shift action removes the first item on the queue and puts it onto the stack . A reduce action is in the form of Reduce-{Binary|Unary}-X , where { Binary|Unary } denotes whether one or two items are to be removed from the stack , and X is the label of a new tree node that will be dominating the removed items . Because a reduction is either unary or binary , the resulting parse tree will only have binary and/or unary branching nodes.
Parse trees are also lexicalized to produce dependency structures . For lexicalization , we used the same head-finding rules reported in ( Bikel , 2004). With this additional information , reduce actions are now in the form of Reduce-{Binary | Unary}-X-Direction . The ? Direction ? tag gives information about whether to take the head-node of the left subtree or the right subtree to be the head of the new tree , in the case of binary reduction . A simple transformation process as described in ( Sagae and Lavie , 2005) is employed to convert between arbitrary branching trees and binary trees . This transformation breaks multi-branching nodes down into binary-branching nodes by inserting temporary nodes ; temporary nodes are collapsed and removed when we transform a binary tree back into a multi-branching tree.
The parsing process succeeds when all the items in the queue have been processed and there is only one item ( the final parse tree ) left on the stack.
If the classifier returns a shift action when there are no items left on the queue , or a reduce action when there are no items on the stack , the 1We constructed our own POS tagger based on SVM ; see
Section 3.3.
parser fails . In this case , the parser simply combines all the items on the stack into one IP node , and outputs this as a partial parse . Sagae and Lavie (2005) have shown that this algorithm has linear time complexity , assuming that classification takes constant time . The next example illustrates the process for the input ? Y ?

3.1 Classifiers
Support Vector Machine : Support Vector Machine is a discriminative classification technique which solves the binary classification problem by finding a hyperplane in a high dimensional space that gives the maximum soft margin , based on the Structural Risk Minimization Principle . We used the TinySVM toolkit ( Kudo and Matsumoto , 2000), with a degree 2 polynomial kernel . To train a multiclass classifier , we used the one-against-all scheme.
MaximumEntropy Classifier : In a
Maximum-entropy model , the goal is to estimate a set of parameters that would maximize the entropy over distributions that satisfy certain constraints . These constraints will force the model to best account for the training data ( Ratnaparkhi , 1999). Maximum-entropy models have been used for Chinese character-based parsing ( Fung et al , 2004; Luo , 2003) and POS tagging ( Ng and Low , 2004). In our experiments , we used Le?s Maxent toolkit ( Zhang , 2004). This implementation uses the Limited-Memory Variable Metric method for parameter estimation . We trained all our models using 300 iterations with no event cutoff , and a Gaussian prior smoothing value of 2. Maxent classifiers output not only a single class label , but also a number of possible class labels and their associated probability estimate.
Decision Tree Classifier : Statistical decision tree is a classic machine learning technique that has been extensively applied to NLP . For example , decision trees were used in the SPATTER system ( Magerman , 1994) to assign probability distribution over the space of possible parse trees.
In our experiment , we used the C4.5 decision tree classifier , and ignored lexical features whose counts were less than 7.
MemoryBased Learning : MemoryBased
Learning approaches the classification problem by storing training examples explicitly in memory , and classifying the current case by finding the most similar stored cases ( using k-nearest-neighbors ). We used the TiMBL toolkit ( Daelemans et al , 2004) in our experiment , with k = 5.
3.2 Feature selection
For each parse state , a set of features are extracted and fed to each classifier . Features are distributionally-derived or linguistically-based , and carry the context of a particular parse state . When input to the classifier , each feature is treated as a contextual predicate which maps an outcome and a context to true , false value.
The specific features used with the classifiers are listed in Table 1.
Sun and Jurafsky (2003) studied the distributional property of rhythm in Chinese , and used the rhythmic feature to augment a PCFG model for a practical shallow parsing task . This feature has the value 1, 2 or 3 for monosyllabic , bisyllabic or multisyllabic nouns or verbs . For noun and verb phrases , the feature is defined as the number of words in the phrase . Sun and Jurafsky found that in NP and VP constructions there are strong constraints on the word length for verbs and nouns ( a kind of rhythm ), and on the number of words in a constituent . We employed these same rhythmic features to see whether this property holds for the Penn Chinese Treebank data , and if it helps in the disambiguation of phrase types . Experiments show that this feature does increase classification accuracy of the SVM model by about 1%.
In both Chinese and English , there are punctuation characters that come in pairs ( e.g ., parentheses ). In Chinese , such pairs are more frequent ( quotes , single quotes , and bookname marks).
During parsing , we note how many opening punc-2 A Boolean value indicates if the queue is empty or not.
3 A Boolean feature indicates whether there is a comma separating S(1) and S(2) or not.
4 Last action given by the classifier , and number of words in S(1) and S(2).
5 Headword and its POS of S(1), S(2), S(3) and S(4), and word and POS of Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) and Q(4).
6 Nonterminal label of the root of S(1) and S(2), and number of punctuations in S(1) and S(2).
7 Rhythmic features and the linear distance between the headwords of the S(1) and S(2).
8 Number of words found so far to be dependents of the headwords of S(1) and S(2).
9 Nonterminal label , POS and headword of the immediate left and right child of the root of S(1) and S(2).
10 Most recently found word and POS pair that is to the left of the headword of S(1) and S(2).
11 Most recently found word and POS pair that is to the right of the headword of S(1) and S(2).
Table 1: Features for classification tuations we have seen on the stack . If the number is odd , then feature 2 will have value 1, otherwise 0. A boolean feature is used to indicate whether or not an odd number of opening punctuations have been seen and a closing punctuation is expected ; in this case the feature gives a strong hint to the parser that all the items in the queue before the closing punctuation , and the items on the stack after the opening punctuation should be under a common constituent node which begins and ends with the two punctuations.
3.3 POS tagging
In our parsing model , POS tagging is treated as a separate problem and it is assumed that the input has already been tagged with POS . To compare with previously published work , we evaluated the parser performance on automatically tagged data . We constructed a simple POS tagger using an SVM classifier . The tagger makes two passes over the input sentence . The first pass extracts features from the two words and POS tags that came before the current word , the two words following the current word , and the current word itself ( the length of the word , whether the word contains numbers , special symbols that separates foreign first and last names , common Chinese family names , western alphabets or dates ). Then the tag is assigned to the word according to SVM classi-fier?s output . In the second pass , additional features such as the POS tags of the two words following the current word , and the POS tag of the current word ( assigned in the first pass ) are used.
This tagger had a measured precision of 92.5% for sentences ? 40 words.
4 Experiments
We performed experiments using the Penn Chinese Treebank . Sections 001-270 (3484 sentences , 84,873 words ) were used for training , 271-300 (348 sentences , 7980 words ) for development , and 271-300 (348 sentences , 7980 words ) for testing.
The whole dataset contains 99629 words , which is about 1/10 of the size of the English Penn Treebank . Standard corpus preparation steps were done prior to parsing , so that empty nodes were removed , and the resulting A over A unary rewrite nodes are collapsed . Functional labels of the nonterminal nodes are also removed , but we did not relabel the punctuations , unlike in ( Jiang , 2004).
Bracket scoring was done by the EVALB program2, and preterminals were not counted as constituents . In all our experiments , we used labeled recall ( LR ), labeled precision ( LP ) and F1 score ( harmonic mean of LR and LP ) as our evaluation metrics.
4.1 Results of different classifiers
Table 2 shows the classification accuracy and parsing accuracy of the four different classifiers on the development set for sentences ? 40 words , with goldstandard POS tagging . The runtime ( Time ) of each model and number of failed parses ( Fail ) are also shown.

Table 2: Comparison of different classifier models ? parsing accuracies on development set for sentences ? 40 words , with goldstandard POS For the DTree learner , we experimented with two different classification strategies . In our first approach , the classification is done in a single stage ( DTree1). The learner is trained for a multi-2http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb / include shift and all possible reduce actions . But this approach yielded a lot of parse failures (42 out of 350 sentences failed during parsing , and partial parse tree was returned ). These failures were mostly due to false shift actions in cases where the queue is empty . To alleviate this problem , we broke the classification process down to two stages ( DTree2). A first stage classifier makes a binary decision on whether the action is shift or reduce.
If the output is reduce , a second-stage classifier decides which reduce action to take . Results showed that breaking down the classification task into two stages increased overall accuracy , and the number of failures was reduced to 30.
The SVM model achieved the highest classification accuracy and the best parsing results . It also successfully parsed all sentences . The Maxent model?s classification error rate (7.4%) was 30% higher than the error rate of the SVM model (5.7%), and its F1 (84.6%) was 3.2% lower than SVM model?s F1 (87.4%). But Maxent model was about 9.5 times faster than the SVM model . The DTree classifier achieved 81.6% LR and 83.6% LP . The MBL model did not perform well ; although MBL and SVM differed in accuracy by only about 3 percent , the parsing results showed a difference of more than 10 percent . One possible explanation for the poor performance of the MBL model is that all the features we used were binary features , and memory-based learner is known to work better with multivalue features than binary features in natural language learning tasks ( van den Bosch and Zavrel , 2000).
In terms of speed and accuracy tradeoff , there is a 5.5% tradeoff in F1 ( relative to SVM?s F1) for a roughly 14 times speedup between SVM and twostage DTree . Maxent is more balanced in the sense that its accuracy was slightly lower (3.2%) than SVM , and was just about as fast as the twostage DTree on the development set . The high speed of the DTree and Maxent models make them very attractive in applications where speed is more critical than accuracy . While the SVM model takes more CPU time , we show in Section 5 that when compared to existing parsers , SVM achieves about the same or higher accuracy but is at least twice as fast.
Using goldstandard POS tagging , the best classifier model ( SVM ) achieved LR of 87.2% and LP of 88.3%, as shown in Table 4. Both measures surpass the previously known best results on parsing using goldstandard tagging . We also tested the SVM model using data automatically tagged by our POS tagger , and it achieved LR of 78.1% and LP of 81.1% for sentences ? 40 words , as shown in Table 3.
4.2 Classifier Ensemble Experiments
Classifier ensemble by itself has been a fruitful research direction in machine learning in recent years . The basic idea in classifier ensemble is that combining multiple classifiers can often give significantly better results than any single classifier alone . We experimented with three different classifier ensemble strategies : classifier stacking , metaclassifier , and simple voting.
Using the SVM classifier?s results as a baseline , we tested these approaches on the development set . In classifier stacking , we collect the outputs from Maxent , DTree and TiMBL , which are all trained on a separate dataset from the training set ( section 400-650 of the Penn Chinese Treebank , smaller than the original training set ). We use their classification output as features , in addition to the original feature set , to train a new SVM model on the original training set . We achieved LR of 90.3% and LP of 90.5% on the development set , a 3.4% and 2.6% improvement in LR and LP , respectively . When tested on the test set , we gained 1% improvement in F1 when goldstandard POS tagging is used . When tested with automatic tagging , we achieved a 0.5% improvement in F1. Using Bikel?s significant tester with 10000 times random shuffle , the pvalue for LR and LP are 0.008 and 0.457, respectively . The increase in recall is statistically significant , and it shows classifier stacking can improve performance.
On the other hand , we did not find metaclassification and simple voting very effective . In simple voting , we make the classifiers to vote in each step for every parse action . The F1 of simple voting method is downgraded by 5.9% relative to SVM model?s F1. By analyzing the inter-agreement among classifiers , we found that there were no cases where Maxent?s top output and DTree?s output were both correct and SVM?s output was wrong . Using the top output from Maxent and DTree directly does not seem to be complementary to SVM.
In the metaclassifier approach , we first collect the output from each classifier trained on sec-Bikel & Chiang 2000 76.8% 77.8% 77.3% - 73.3% 74.6% 74.0% - - - - - Levy & Manning 2003 79.2% 78.4% 78.8% - - - - - - - - - Xiong et al 2005 78.7% 80.1% 79.4% - - - - - - - - - Bikel?s Thesis 2004 78.0% 81.2% 79.6% - 74.4% 78.5% 76.4% - - - - - Chiang & Bikel 2002 78.8% 81.1% 79.9% - 75.2% 78.0% 76.6% - - - - - Jiang?s Thesis 2004 80.1% 82.0% 81.1% 92.4% - - - - - - - - Sun & Jurafsky 2004 85.5% 86.4% 85.9% - - - - - 83.3% 82.2% 82.7% - DTree model 71.8% 76.9% 74.4% 92.5% 69.2% 74.5% 71.9% 92.2% 68.7% 74.2% 71.5% 92.1% SVM model 78.1% 81.1% 79.6% 92.5% 75.5% 78.5% 77.0% 92.2% 75.0% 78.0% 76.5% 92.1% Stacked classifier model 79.2% 81.1% 80.1% 92.5% 76.7% 78.4% 77.5% 92.2% 76.2% 78.0% 77.1% 92.1% Table 3: Comparison with related work on the test set using automatically generated POS tion 1210 ( roughly 3/4 of the entire training set).
Then specifically for Maxent , we collected the top output as well as its associated probability estimate . Then we used the outputs and probability estimate as features to train an SVM classifier that makes a decision on which classifier to pick.
Metaclassifier results did not change at all from our baseline . In fact , the metaclassifier always picked SVM as its output . This agrees with our observation for the simple voting case.
5 Comparison with Related Work
Bikel and Chiang (2000) constructed two parsers using a lexicalized PCFG model that is based on Collins ? model 2 ( Collins , 1999), and a statistical Tree-adjoining Grammar(TAG ) model . They used the same train/development/test split , and achieved LR/LP of 76.8%/77.8%. In Bikel?s thesis (2004), the same Collins emulation model was used , but with tweaked head-finding rules.
Also a POS tagger was used for assigning tags for unseen words . The refined model achieved LR/LP of 78.0%/81.2%. Chiang and Bikel (2002) used insideoutside unsupervised learning algorithm to augment the rules for finding heads , and achieved an improved LR/LP of 78.8%/81.1%.
Levy and Manning (2003) used a factored model that combines an unlexicalized PCFG model with a dependency model . They achieved LR/LP of 79.2%/78.4% on a different test/development split . Xiong et al (2005) used a similar model to the BBN?s model in ( Bikel and Chiang , 2000), and augmented the model by semantic categorical information and heuristic rules . They achieved LR/LP of 78.7%/80.1%. Hearne and Way (2004) used a Data-Oriented Parsing ( DOP ) approach that was optimized for topdown computation.
They achieved F1 of 71.3 on a different test and training set . Jiang (2004) reported LR/LP of 80.1%/82.0% on sentences ? 40 words ( results not available for sentences ? 100 words ) by applying Collins ? parser to Chinese . In Sun and Jurafsky (2004)?s work on Chinese shallow semantic parsing , they also applied Collin?s parser to Chinese . They reported up-to-date the best parsing performance on Chinese Treebank . They achieved LR/LP of 85.5%/86.4% on sentences ? 40 words , and LR/LP of 83.3%/82.2% on sentences ? 100 words , far surpassing all other previously reported results . Luo (2003) and Fung et al . (2004) addressed the issue of Chinese text segmentation in their work by constructing character-based parsers . Luo integrated segmentation , POS tagging and parsing into one maximum-entropy framework . He achieved a F1 score of 81.4% in parsing . But the score was achieved using 90% of the 250K-CTB ( roughly 2.5 times bigger than our training set ) for training and 10% for testing . Fung et al(2004) also took the maximum-entropy modeling approach , but augmented by transformationbased learning . They used the standard training and testing split . When tested with goldstandard segmentation , they achieved a F1 score of 79.56%, but POS-tagged words were treated as constituents in their evaluation.
In comparison with previous work , our parser?s accuracy is very competitive . Compared to Jiang?s work and Sun and Jurafsky?s work , the classifier ensemble model of our parser is lagging behind by 1% and 5.8% in F1, respectively . But compared to all other works , our classifier stacking model gave better or equal results for all three measures.
In particular , the classifier ensemble model and SVM model of our parser achieved second and third highest LP , LR and F1 for sentences ? 100 words as shown in Table 3. ( Sun and Jurafsky did not report results on sentences ? 100 words , but it is worth noting that out of all the test sentences , Jiang (2004) and Bikel (2004)3 also evaluated their parsers on the test set for sentences ? 40 words , using goldstandard POS tagged input . Our parser gives significantly better results as shown in Table 4. The implication of this result is twofold . On one hand , it shows that if POS tagging accuracy can be increased , our parser is likely to benefit more than the other two models ; on the other hand , it also indicates that our deterministic model is less resilient to POS errors . Further detailed analysis is called for , to study the extent to which POS tagging errors affects the deterministic parsing model.

To measure efficiency , we ran two publicly available parsers ( Levy and Manning?s PCFG parser (2003) and Bikel?s parser (2004)) on the standard test set and compared the run-time4. The runtime of these parsers are shown in minute:second format in Table 5. Our SVM model is more than 2 times faster than Levy and Manning?s parser , and more than 13 times faster than Bikel?s parser . Our DTree model is 40 times faster than Levy and Manning?s parser , and 270 times faster than Bikel?s parser . Another advantage of our parser is that it does not take as much memory as these other parsers do . In fact , none of the models except MBL takes more than 60 megabytes of memory at runtime . In comparison , Levy and Manning?s PCFG parser requires more than 400 megabytes of memory when parsing long sentences (70 words or longer).
6 Discussion and future work
One unique attraction of this deterministic parsing framework is that advances in machine learning field can be directly applied to parsing , which 3Bikel?s parser used goldstandard POS tags for unseen words only . Also , the results are obtained from a parser trained on 250K-CTB , about 2.5 times bigger than CTB 1.0.
4All the experiments were conducted on a Pentium IV 2.4GHz machine with 2GB of RAM.

Bikel 54m 6s
Levy & Manning 8m 12s
Our DTree model 0m 14s
Our Maxent model 0m 24s
Our SVM model 3m 50s
Table 5: Comparison of parsing speed opens up lots of possibilities for continuous improvements , both in terms of accuracy and efficiency . For example , in this paper we experimented with one method of simple voting . An alternative way of doing simple voting is to let the parsers vote on membership of constituents after each parser has produced its own parse tree ( Henderson and Brill , 1999), instead of voting at each step during parsing.
Our initial attempt to increase the accuracy of the DTree model by applying boosting techniques did not yield satisfactory results . In our experiment , we implemented the AdaBoost.M1 ( Freund and Schapire , 1996) algorithm using resampling to vary the training set distribution.
Results showed AdaBoost suffered severe overfitting problems and hurts accuracy greatly , even with a small number of samples . One possible reason for this is that our sample space is very unbalanced across the different classes . A few classes have lots of training examples while a large number of classes are rare , which could raise the chance of overfitting.
In our experiments , SVM model gave better results than the Maxent model . But it is important to note that although the same set of features were used in both models , a degree 2 polynomial kernel was used in the SVM classifier while Maxent only has degree 1 features . In our future work , we will experiment with degree 2 features and L1 regularization in the Maxent model , which may give us closer performance to the SVM model with a much faster speed.
7 Conclusion
In this paper , we presented a novel deterministic parser for Chinese constituent parsing . Using goldstandard POS tags , our best model ( using stacked classifiers ) runs in linear time and has labeled recall and precision of 88.3% and 88.1%, respectively , surpassing the best published results.
And with a tradeoff of 56% in accuracy , our DTree and Maxent parsers run at speeds 40-270 times faster than state-of-the-art parsers . Our re-framework is a viable and effective approach to Chinese parsing . For future work , we will further improve the speed and accuracy of our models , and apply them to more Chinese and multilingual natural language applications that require high speed and accurate parsing.
