Abstract
The importance of the new textual genres such as blogs or forum entries is growing in parallel with the evolution of the Social Web . This paper presents two corpora of blog posts in English and in Spanish , annotated according to the EmotiBlog annotation scheme . Furthermore , we created 20 factual and opinionated questions for each language and also the Gold Standard for their answers in the corpus . The purpose of our work is to study the challenges involved in a mixed fact and opinion question answering setting by comparing the performance of two Question Answering ( QA ) systems as far as mixed opinion and factual setting is concerned . The first one is open domain , while the second one is opinion-oriented . We evaluate separately the two systems in both languages and propose possible solutions to improve QA systems that have to process mixed questions.
Introduction and motivation
In the last few years , the number of blogs has grown exponentially . Thus , the Web contains more and more subjective texts . A research from the Pew Institute shows that 75.000 blogs are created daily ( Pang and Lee , 2008). They approach a great variety of topics ( computer science , sociology , political science or economics ) and are written by different types of people , thus are a relevant resource for large community behavior analysis . Due to the high volume of data contained in blogs , new Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) resources , tools and methods are needed in order to manage their language understanding . Our fist contribution consists in carrying out a multilingual research , for English and Spanish . Secondly , many sources are present in blogs , as people introduce quotes from newspaper articles or other information to support their arguments and make references to previous posts in the discussion thread . Thus , when performing a task such as Question Answering ( QA ), many new aspects have to be taken into consideration.
Previous studies in the field ( Stoyanov , Cardie and Wiebe , 2005) showed that certain types of queries , which are factual in nature , require the use of Opinion Mining ( OM ) resources and techniques to retrieve the correct answers . A further contribution this paper brings is the analysis and definition of the criteria for the discrimination among types of factual versus opinionated questions . Previous researchers mainly concentrated on newspaper collections . We formulated and annotated of a set of questions and answers over a multilingual blog collection . A further contribution is the evaluation and comparison of two different approaches to QA a fact-oriented one and another designed for opinion QA scenarios.
Related work
Research in building factoid QA systems has a long history . However , it is only recently that studies have started to focus also on the creation and development of QA systems for opinions.
Recent years have seen the growth of interest in this field , both by the research performed and the publishing of various studies on the requirements anov , Cardie and Wiebe , 2005), ( Pustejovsky and Wiebe , 2006), as well as the organization of international conferences that promote the creation of effective QA systems both for general and subjective texts , as , for example , the Text Analysis Conference ( TAC)1. Last year?s TAC 2008 Opinion QA track proposed a mixed setting of factoid (? rigid list ?) and opinion questions (? squishy list ?), to which the traditional systems had to be adapted . The Alyssa system ( Shen et al ., 2007), classified the polarity of the question and of the extracted answer snippet , using a Support Vector Machines classifier trained on the MPQA corpus ( Wiebe , Wilson and Cardie , 2005), English NTCIR2 data and rules based on the subjectivity lexicon ( Wilson , Wiebe and Hoffman , 2005). The PolyU ( Wenjie et al , 2008) system determines the sentiment orientation with two estimated language models for the positive versus negative categories . The QUANTA ( Li , 2008) system detects the opinion holder , the object and the polarity of the opinion using a semantic labeler based on PropBank3 and some manually defined patterns.
Evaluation
In order to carry out our evaluation , we employed a corpus of blog posts presented in ( Boldrini et al , 2009). It is a collection of blog entries in English , Spanish and Italian . However , for this research we used the first two languages.
We annotated it using EmotiBlog ( Balahur et al , 2009) and we also created a list of 20 questions for each language . Finally , we produced the Gold Standard , by labeling the corpus with the correct answers corresponding to the questions.

Table 1: List of question in English and Spanish As it can be seen in the table above , we created factoid ( F ) and opinion ( O ) queries for English and for Spanish ; however , there are some that could be defined between factoid and opinion ( F/O ) and the system can retrieve multiple answers after having selected , for example , the polarity of the sentences in the corpus.
1.2 Performance of the two systems
We evaluated and compared the generic QA system of the University of Alicante ( Moreda et al , 2008) and the opinion QA system presented in ( Balahur et al , 2008), in which Named Entity Recognition with LingPipe4 and FreeLing5 was 4 http://alias-i.com/lingpipe / 5 http://garraf.epsevg.upc.es/freeling / containing NEs of the question Expected Answer Type ( EAT ). Table 2 presents the results obtained for English and Table 3 for Spanish . We indicate the id of the question ( Q ), the question type ( T ) and the number of answer of the Gold Standard ( A ). We present the number of the retrieved questions by the traditional system ( TQA ) and by the opinion one ( OQA ). We take into account the first 1, 5, 10 and 50 answers.

Table 3: Results for Spanish 1.3 Results and discussion There are many problems involved when trying to perform mixed fact and opinion QA . The first can be the ambiguity of the questions e.g . ? De d?nde viene la riqueza de EEUU ?. The answer can be explicitly stated in one of the blog sentences , or a system might have to infer them from assumptions made by the bloggers and their comments . Moreover , most of the opinion questions have longer answers , not just a phrase snippet , but up to 2 or 3 sentences . As we can observe in Table 2, the questions for which the TQA system performed better were the pure factual ones (1, 3, 4, 8, 10 and 14), although in some cases ( question number 14) the OQA system retrieved more correct answers . At the same time , opinion queries , although revolving around NEs , were not answered by the traditional QA system , but were satisfactorily answered by the opinion QA system (2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12). Questions 18 and 20 were not correctly answered by any of the two systems . We believe the reason is that question 18 was ambiguous as far as polarity of the opinions expressed in the answer snippets (? improvement ? does not translate to either ? positive ? or ? negative ?) and question 20 referred to the title of a project proposal that was not annotated by any of the tools used . Thus , as part of the future work in our OQA system , we must add a component for the identification of quotes and titles , as well as explore a wider range of polar-ity/opinion scales . Furthermore , questions 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 contain both factual as well as opinion aspects and the OQA system performed better than the TQA , although in some cases , answers were lost due to the artificial boosting of the queries containing NEs of the EAT ( Expected Answer Type ). Therefore , it is obvious that an extra method for answer ranking should be used , as Answer Validation techniques using Textual Entailment . In Table 3, the OQA missed some of the answers due to erroneous sentence splitting , either separating text into two sentences where it was not the case or concatenating two consecutive sentences ; thus missing out on one of two consecutively annotated answers . Examples are questions number 16 and 17, where many blog entries enumerated the different arguments in consecutive sentences . Another source of problems was the fact that we gave a high weight to the presence of the NE of the sought type within the retrieved snippet and in some cases the name was misspelled in the blog entries , whereas in other NER performed by an entity , failed to annotate it or wrongfully annotated words as being NEs . Not of less importance is the question duality aspect in question 17. Bush is commented in more than 600 sentences ; therefore , when polarity is not specified , it is difficult to correctly rank the answers . Finally , also the problems of temporal expressions and the coreference need to be taken into account.
Conclusions and future work
In this article , we created a collection of both factual and opinion queries in Spanish and English . We labeled the Gold Standard of the answers in the corpora and subsequently we employed two QA systems , one open domain , one for opinion questions . Our main objective was to compare the performances of these two systems and analyze their errors , proposing solutions to creating an effective QA system for both factoid an opinionated queries . We saw that , even using specialized resources , the task of QA is still challenging . Opinion QA can benefit from a snippet retrieval at a paragraph level , since in many cases the answers were not simple parts of sentences , but consisted in two or more consecutive sentences . On the other hand , we have seen cases in which each of three different consecutive sentences was a separate answer to a question . Our future work contemplates the study of the impact anaphora resolution and temporality on opinion QA , as well as the possibility to use Answer Validation techniques for answer reranking.
