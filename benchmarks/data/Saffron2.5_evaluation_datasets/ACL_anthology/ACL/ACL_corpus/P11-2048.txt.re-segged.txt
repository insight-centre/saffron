Abstract
In this paper , we extend distant supervision ( DS ) based on Wikipedia for Relation Extraction ( RE ) by considering ( i ) relations defined in external repositories , e.g . YAGO , and ( ii ) any subset of Wikipedia documents . We show that training data constituted by sentences containing pairs of named entities in target relations is enough to produce reliable supervision . Our experiments with state-of-the-art relation extraction models , trained on the above data , show a meaningful F1 of 74.29% on a manually annotated test set : this highly improves the state-of-art in RE using DS . Additionally , our end-to-end experiments demonstrated that our extractors can be applied to any general text document.
1 Introduction
Relation Extraction ( RE ) from text as defined in ACE ( Doddington et al , 2004) concerns the extraction of relationships between two entities . This is typically carried out by applying supervised learning , e.g . ( Zelenko et al , 2002; Culotta and Sorensen , 2004; Bunescu and Mooney , 2005) by using a hand-labeled corpus . Although , the resulting models are far more accurate than unsupervised approaches , they suffer from the following drawbacks : ( i ) they require labeled data , which is usually costly to produce ; ( ii ) they are typically domain-dependent as different domains involve different relations ; and ( iii ), even in case the relations do not change , they result biased toward the text feature distributions of the training domain.
The drawbacks above would be alleviated if data from several different domains and relationships were available . A form of weakly supervision , specifically named distant supervision ( DS ) when applied to Wikipedia , e.g . ( Banko et al , 2007; Mintz et al , 2009; Hoffmann et al , 2010) has been recently developed to meet the requirement above . The main idea is to exploit ( i ) relation repositories , e.g . the Infobox , x , of Wikipedia to define a set of relation types RT ( x ) and ( ii ) the text in the page associated with x to produce the training sentences , which are supposed to express instances of RT ( x).
Previous work has shown that selecting the sentences containing the entities targeted by a given relation is enough accurate ( Banko et al , 2007; Mintz et al , 2009) to provide reliable training data . However , only ( Hoffmann et al , 2010) used DS to define extractors that are supposed to detect all the relation instances from a given input text . This is a harder test for the applicability of DS but , at the same time , the resulting extractor is very valuable : it can find rare relation instances that might be expressed in only one document . For example , the relation President(Barrack Obama , United States ) can be extracted from thousands of documents thus there is a large chance of acquiring it . In contrast , Pres-ident(Eneko Agirre , SIGLEX ) is probably expressed in very few documents , increasing the complexity for obtaining it.
In this paper , we extend DS by ( i ) considering relations from semantic repositories different from Wikipedia , i.e . YAGO , and (2) using training instances derived from any Wikipedia document . This allows for ( i ) potentially obtaining training data sources ; ( ii ) meaningfully enlarging the size of the DS data since the relation examples can be extracted from any Wikipedia document 1.
Additionally , by following previous work , we define state-of-the-art RE models based on kernel methods ( KM ) applied to syntactic/semantic structures . We use tree and sequence kernels that can exploit structural information and interdependencies among labels . Experiments show that our models are flexible and robust to Web documents as we achieve the interesting F1 of 74.29% on 52 YAGO relations . This is even more appreciable if we approximately compare with the previous result on RE using DS , i.e . 61% ( Hoffmann et al , 2010). Although the experiment setting is different from ours , the improvement of about 13 absolute percent points demonstrates the quality of our model.
Finally , we also provide a system for extracting relations from any text . This required the definition of a robust Named Entity Recognizer ( NER ), which is also trained on weakly supervised Wikipedia data.
Consequently , our end-to-end RE system is applicable to any document . This is another major improvement on previous work . The satisfactory RE F1 of 67% for 52 Wikipedia relations suggests that our model is also successfully applicable in real scenarios.
1.1 Related Work
RE generally relates to the extraction of relational facts , or world knowledge from the Web ( Yates , 2009). To identify semantic relations using machine learning , three learning settings have been applied , namely supervised methods , e.g . ( Zelenko et al , 2002; Culotta and Sorensen , 2004; Kambhatla , 2004), semi supervised methods , e.g . ( Brin , 1998; Agichtein and Gravano , 2000), and unsupervised method , e.g . ( Hasegawa et al , 2004; Banko et al , 2007). Work on supervised Relation Extraction has mostly employed kernelbased approaches , e.g . ( Zelenko et al , 2002; Culotta and Sorensen , 2004; Culotta and Sorensen , 2004; Bunescu and Mooney , 2005; Zhang et al , 2005; Bunescu , 2007; Nguyen et al , 2009; Zhang et al , 2006). However , 1Previous work assumes the page related to the Infobox as the only source for the training data.

Another solution proposed in ( Riedel et al , 2010) was to adapt models trained in one domain to other text domains.
2 Resources and Dataset Creation
In this section , we describe the resources for the creation of an annotated dataset based on distant supervision . We use YAGO , a large knowledge base of entities and relations , and Freebase , a collection of Wikipedia articles . Our procedure uses entities and facts from YAGO to provide relation instances . For each pair of entities that appears in some YAGO relation , we retrieve all the sentences of the Freebase documents that contain such entities.
2.1 YAGO
YAGO ( Suchanek et al , 2007) is a huge semantic knowledge base derived from WordNet and Wikipedia . It comprises more than 2 million entities ( like persons , organizations , cities , etc .) and 20 million facts connecting these entities . These include the taxonomic IsA hierarchy as well as semantic relations between entities.
We use the YAGO version of 2008-w40-2 with a manually confirmed accuracy of 95% for 99 relations . However , some of them are ( a ) trivial , e.g.
familyNameOf ; ( b ) numerical attributes that change over time , e.g . hasPopulation ; ( c ) symmetric , e.g.
hasPredecessor ; ( d ) used only for data management , e.g . describes or foundIn . Therefore , we removed those irrelevant relations and obtained 1,489,156 instances of 52 relation types to be used with our DS approach.
278 2.2 Freebase
To access to Wikipedia documents , we used Freebase ( March 27, 2010 ( Metaweb Technologies , 2010)), which is a dump of the full text of all Wikipedia articles . For our experiments , we used 100,000 articles . Out of them , only 28,074 articles contain at least one relation for a total of 68,429 of relation instances . These connect 744,060 entities , 97,828 dates and 203,981 numerical attributes.
Temporal and Numerical Expression
Wikipedia articles are marked with entities like Person or Organization but not with dates or numerical attributes . This prevents to extract interesting relations between entities and dates , e.g . John F.
Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917 or between entities and numerical attributes , e.g . The novel Gone with the wind has 1037 pages . Thus we designed 18 regular expressions to extract dates and other 25 to extract numerical attributes , which range from integer number to ordinal number , percentage , monetary , speed , height , weight , area , time , and ISBN.
2.3 Distant Supervision and generalization Distant supervision ( DS ) for RE is based on the following assumption : ( i ) a sentence is connected in some way to a database of relations and ( ii ) such sentence contains the pair of entities participating in a target relation ; ( iii ) then it is likely that such sentence expresses the relation . In traditional DS the point ( i ) is implemented by the Infobox , which is connected to the sentences by a proximity relation ( same page of the sentence).
In our extended DS , we relax ( i ) by allowing for the use of an external DB of relations such as YAGO and any document of Freebase ( a collection of Wikipedia documents ). The alignment between YAGO and Freebase is implemented by the Wikipedia page link : for example the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James Cameron refers to the entity James Cameron.
We use an efficient procedure formally described in Alg . 2.1: for each Wikipedia article in Freebase , we scan all of its NEs . Then , for each pair of entities2 seen in the sentence , we query YAGO to 2Our algorithm is robust to the lack of knowledge about the existence of any relation between two entities . If the relation retrieve the relation instance connecting these entities . Note that a simplified version of our approach is the following : for any YAGO relation instance , scan all the sentences of all Wikipedia articles to test point ( ii ). Unfortunately , this procedure is impossible in practice due to millions of relation instances in YAGO and millions of Wikipedia articles in Freebase , i.e . an order of magnitude of 1014 iterations3.
3 Distant Supervised Learning with
Kernels
We model relation extraction ( RE ) using state-of-the-art classifiers based on kernel methods . The main idea is that syntactic/semantic structures are used to represent relation instances . We followed the model in ( Nguyen et al , 2009) that has shown significant improvement on the state-of-the-art . This combines a syntactic tree kernel and a polynomial kernel over feature extracted from the entities:
CK1 = ? ? KP + (1? ?) ? TK (1) where ? is a coefficient to give more or less impact to the polynomial kernel,KP , and TK is the syntactic tree kernel ( Collins and Duffy , 2001). The best model combines the advantages of the two parsing paradigms by adding the kernel above with six sequence kernels ( described in ( Nguyen et al , 2009)).
CSK = ? ? KP +(1??) ?( TK + ? i=1,..,6
SKi ) (2)
Such kernels cannot be applied to Wikipedia documents as the entity category , e.g . Person or Organization , is in general missing . Thus , we adapted them by simply removing the category label in the nodes of the trees and in the sequences . This data transformation corresponds to different kernels ( see ( Cristianini and ShaweTaylor , 2000)).
4 Experiments
We carried out test to demonstrate that our DS approach produces reliable and practically usable relation extractors . For this purpose , we test them on instance is not in YAGO , it is simply assumed as a negative instance even if such relation is present in other DBs.

4.1 Experimental setting
We used the DS dataset generated from YAGO and Wikipedia articles , as described in the algorithm ( Alg . 2.1). The candidate relations are generated by iterating all pairs of entity mentions in the same sentence . Relation detection is formulated as a multiclass classification problem . The One vs . Rest strategy is employed by selecting the instance with largest margin as the final answer . We carried out 5-fold crossvalidation with the tree kernel toolkit4 ( Moschitti , 2004; Moschitti , 2008).
4.2 Results on Wikipedia RE
We created a test set by sampling 200 articles from Freebase ( these articles are not used for training).
An expert annotator , for each sentence , labeled all possible pairs of entities with one of the 52 relations from YAGO , where the entities were already marked . This process resulted in 2,601 relation instances.
Table 1 shows the performance of individual classifiers as well as the overall Micro-average F1 for our adapted CSK : we note that it reaches an F1score of 74.29%. This can be compared with the Micro-average F1 of CK1, i.e . 71.21%. The lower result suggests that the combination of dependency and constituent syntactic structures is very important : +3.08 absolute percent points on CK1, which only uses constituency trees.

4.3 End-to-end Relation Extraction
Previous work in RE uses gold entities available in the annotated corpus ( i.e . ACE ) but in real applications these are not available . Therefore , we perform experiments with automatic entities . For their extraction , we follow the feature design in ( Nguyen et al , 2010), using CRF ++ 5 with unigram/features and Freebase as learning source . Dates and numerical attributes required a different treatment , so we use the patterns described in Section 2.3. The results reported in Table 2 are rather lower than in standard NE recognition . This is due to the high complexity of predicting the boundaries of thousands of different categories in YAGO.
Our end-to-end RE system can be applied to any text fragment so we could experiment with it and any Wikipedia document . This allowed us to carry out an accurate evaluation . The results are shown in Table 2. We note that , without gold entities , RE from Wikipedia still achieves a satisfactory performance of 67.00% F1.
5 Conclusion
This paper proposes two main contributions to Relation Extraction : ( i ) a new approach to distant supervision ( DS ) to create training data using relations defined in different sources , i.e . YAGO , and potentially using any Wikipedia document ; and ( ii ) end-to-end systems applicable both to Wikipedia pages as well as to any natural language text.
The results show : 1. A high F1 of 74.29% on extracting 52 YAGO relations from any Wikipedia document ( not only from Infobox related pages ). This result improves on previous work by 13.29 absolute percent points ( approximated comparison).
This is a rough approximation since on one hand , ( Hoffmann et al , 2010) experimented 5http://crfpp.sourceforge.net sults based on 52 relations cannot be compared with it ( i.e . our multiclassifier has two orders of magnitude less of categories ). On the other hand , the only experiment that can give a realistic measurement is the one on hand-labeled test set ( testing on data automatically labelled by DS does not provide a realistic outcome).
The size of such test set is comparable with ours , i.e . 100 documents vs . our set of 200 documents . Although , we do not know how many types of relations were involved in the test of ( Hoffmann et al , 2010), it is clear that only a small subset of the 5000 relations could have been measured . Also , we have to consider that , in ( Hoffmann et al , 2010), only one relation extractor is supposed to be learnt from one article ( by using Infobox ) whereas we can potentially extract several relations even from the same sentence.
2. The importance of using both dependency and constituent structures (+3.08% when adding dependency information to RE based on constituent trees).
3. Our end-to-end system is useful for real applications as it shows a meaningful accuracy , i.e.
67% on 52 relations.
For this reason , we decided to make available the DS dataset , the manually annotated test set and the computational data ( tree and sequential structures with labels).
