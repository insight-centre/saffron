Expert search , in which given a query a ranked list of experts instead of documents is returned , has been intensively studied recently due to its importance in facilitating the needs of both information access and knowledge discovery . Many approaches have been proposed , including metadata extraction , expert profile building , and formal model generation . However , all of them conduct expert search with a coarse-grained approach . With these , further improvements on expert search are hard to achieve . In this paper , we propose conducting expert search with a finegrained approach . Specifically , we utilize more specific evidences existing in the documents . An evidence-oriented probabilistic model for expert search and a method for the implementation are proposed . Experimental results show that the proposed model and the implementation are highly effective.
1 Introduction Nowadays , team work plays a more important role than ever in problem solving . For instance , within an enterprise , people handle new problems usually by leveraging the knowledge of experienced colleagues . Similarly , within research communities , novices step into a new research area often by learning from well-established researchers in the research area . All these scenarios involve asking the questions like ? who is an expert on X ?? or ? who knows about X ?? Such questions , which cannot be answered easily through traditional document search , raise a new requirement of searching people with certain expertise . To meet that requirement , a new task , called expert search , has been proposed and studied intensively . For example , TREC 2005, 2006, and 2007 provide the task of expert search within the enterprise track . In the TREC setting , expert search is defined as : given a query , a ranked list of experts is returned . In this paper , we engage our study in the same setting . Many approaches to expert search have been proposed by the participants of TREC and other researchers . These approaches include metadata extraction ( Cao et al , 2005), expert profile building ( Craswell , 2001, Fu et al , 2007), data fusion ( Maconald and Ounis , 2006), query expansion ( Macdonald and Ounis , 2007), hierarchical language model ( Petkova and Croft , 2006), and formal model generation ( Balog et al , 2006; Fang et al , 2006). However , all of them conduct expert search with what we call a coarse-grained approach . The discovering and use of evidence for expert locating is carried out under a grain of document . With it , further improvements on expert search are hard to achieve . This is because different blocks ( or segments ) of electronic documents usually present different functions and qualities and thus different impacts for expert locating . In contrast , this paper is concerned with proposing a probabilistic model for finegrained expert search . In finegrained expert search , we are to extract and use evidence of expert search ( usually blocks of documents ) directly . Thus , the proposed probabilistic model incorporates evidence of expert search explicitly as a part of it . A piece of finegrained evidence is formally defined as a quadruple , < topic , person , relation , document >, which denotes the fact that a topic and a person , with a certain relation between them , are found in a specific document . The intuition behind the quadruple is that a query may be matched with phrases in various forms ( denoted as topic here ) and an expert candidate may appear with various name masks ( denoted as person here ), e.g ., full name , email , or abbreviated names . Given a topic and person , relation type is used to measure their closeness and 2.1 Expert Search Systems One setting for automatic expert search is to assume that data from specific resources are available . For example , Expertise Recommender ( Kautz et al , 1996), Expertise Browser ( Mockus and Herbsleb , 2002) and the system in ( McDonald and Ackerman , 1998) make use of log data in software development systems to find experts . Yet another approach is to mine expert and expertise from email communications ( Campbell et al , 2003; Dom et al 2003; Sihn and Heeren , 2001). Searching expert from general documents has also been studied ( Davenport and Prusak , 1998; Mattox et al , 1999; Hertzum and Pejtersen , 2000). P@NOPTIC employs what is referred to as the ? profile-based ? approach in searching for experts ( Craswell et al , 2001). Expert/Expert-Locating ( EEL ) system ( Steer and Lochbaum , 1988) uses the same approach in searching for expert groups . DEMOIR ( Yimam , 1996) enhances the profile-based approach by separating cooccurrences into different types . In essence , the profile-based approach utilizes the cooccurrences between query words and people within documents . 2.2 Expert Search at TREC A task on expert search was organized within the enterprise track at TREC 2005, 2006 and 2007 ( Craswell et al , 2005; Soboroff et al , 2006; Bailey et al , 2007). Many approaches have been proposed for tackling the expert search task within the TREC track . Cao et al (2005) propose a twostage model with a set of extracted metadata . Balog et al (2006) compare two generative models for expert search . Fang et al (2006) further extend their generative model by introducing the prior of expert distribution and relevance feedback . Petkova and Croft (2006) further extend the profile based method by using a hierarchical language model . Macdonald and Ounis (2006) investigate the effectiveness of the voting approach and the associated data fusion techniques . However , such models are conducted in a coarse-grain scope of document as discussed before . In contrast , our study focuses on proposing a model for conducting expert search in a fine-grain scope of evidence ( local context ). 3 Fine-grained Expert Search Our research is to investigate a direct use of the local contexts for expert search . We call each local context of such kind as finegrained evidence . In this work , a finegrained evidence is formally defined as a quadruple , < topic , person , relation , ( | ) ( , | ) ( | , ) ( | ) e e
P c q P c e q
P c e q P e q = = ? ? , (1) where e denotes a quadruple of evidence . Using the relaxation that the probability of c is independent of a query q given an evidence e , we can reduce Equation (1) as , ( | ) ( | ) ( | ) e
P c q P c e P e q = ? . (2) Compared to previous work , our model conducts expert search with a new way in which local contexts of evidence are used to bridge a query q and an expert candidate c . The new way enables the expert search system to explore various local contexts in a precise manner . In the following subsections , we will detail two submodels : the expert matching model P(c|e ) and the evidence matching model P(e|q ). 3.2 Expert Matching Model We expand the evidence e as quadruple < topic , people , relation , document > (< t , p , r , d > for short ) for expert matching . Given a set of related evidences , we assume that the generation of an expert candidate c is independent with topic t and omit it in expert matching . Therefore , we simplify the expert matching formula as below : ),|()|(),,|()|( drpPpcPdrpcPecP == , (3) where P(c|p ) depends on how an expert candidate c matches to a person occurrence p ( e.g . full name or email of a person ). The different ways of matching an expert candidate c with a person occurrence p results in varied qualities . P(c|p ) represents the quality . P(p|r,d ) expresses the probability of an occurrence p given a relation r and a document d . P(p|r,d ) is estimated in MLE as , ),( ),,( ),|( drL drpfreq drpP = , (4) where freq(p,r,d ) is the frequency of person p matched by relation r in document d , and L(r , d ) is the frequency of all the persons matched by relation r in d . This estimation can further be smoothed by using the evidence collection as follows : ? ? ?+=
Dd
S
D drpP drpPdrpP ' || )',|( )1(),|(),|( ?? , (5) where D denotes the whole document collection . | D | is the total number of documents . We use Dirichlet prior in smoothing of parameter ?:
KdrL drL + = ),( ),(? , (6) where K is the average frequency of all the experts in the collection.
3.3 Evidence Matching Model By expanding the evidence e and employing independence assumption , we have the following formula for evidence matching : )|()|()|()|( )|,,,()|( qdPqrPqpPqtP qdrptPqeP = = . (7) In the following , we are to explain what these four terms represent and how they can be estimated . The first term P(t|q ) represents the probability that a query q matches to a topic t in evidence . Recall that a query q may match a topic t in various ways , not necessarily being identical to t . For example , both topic ? semantic web ? and ? semantic web search engine ? can match the query ? semantic web search engine ?. The probability is defined as )()|( pPqpP ? . (9) The prior probability can be estimated by MLE , i.e ., the ratio of total occurrences of person p in the collection . The third term represents the probability that a relation r is generated from a query q . Here , we approximate the probability as ))(()|( rtypePqrP ? , (10) where type(r ) represents the way r connecting query and expert . P(type(r )) represents the reliability of relation type of r . Following the Bayes rule , the last term can be transformed as )()|( )( )()|( )|( dPdqP qP dPdqP qdP ?= , (11) where priority distribution P(d ) can be estimated based on static rank , e.g ., PageRank ( Brin and Page , 1998). P(q|d ) can be estimated by using a standard language model for IR ( Ponte and Croft , 1998). In summary , Equation (7) is converted to ( ) )()|())(()(),()|( dPdqPrtypePpPqttypePqeP ? . (12) 3.4 Evidence Merging We assume that the ranking score of an expert can be acquired by summing up together all scores of the supporting evidences . Thus we calculate experts ? scores by aggregating the scores from all evidences as in Equation (1). 4 Implementation The implementation of the proposed model consists of two stages , namely evidence extraction and evidence quality evaluation.
4.1 Evidence Extraction Recall that we define an evidence for expert search as a quadruple < topic , person , relation , document >. The evidence extraction covers the extraction of the first three elements , namely person identification , topic discovering and relation extraction . 4.1.1 Person Identification The occurrences of an expert can be in various forms , such as name and email address . We call each type of form an expert mask . Table 1 provides a statistic on various masks on the basis of W3C corpus . In Table 1, rate is the proportion of the person occurrences with relevant masks to the person occurrences with any of the masks , and ambiguity is defined as the probability that a mask is shared by more than one expert . Mask Rate/Ambiguity Sample Full Name(NF ) 48.2% / 0.0000 Ritu Raj Tiwari Email Name(NE ) 20.1% / 0.0000 rtiwari@nuance.com Combined Name ( NC ) 4.2% /0.3992 Tiwari , Ritu R ; R R Tiwari Abbr . Name(NA ) 21.2% / 0.4890 Ritu Raj ; Ritu Short Name(NS ) 0.7% / 0.6396 RRT Alias , new email ( NAE ) 7% / 0.4600 Ritiwari rti-wari@hotmail.com Table 1. Various masks and their ambiguity 1) Every occurrence of a candidate?s email address is normalized to the appropriate candidate_id . 2) Every occurrence of a candidate?s full_name is normalized to the appropriate candidate_id if there is no ambiguity ; otherwise , the occurrence is normalized to the candidate_id of the most frequent candidate with that full_name . 3) Every occurrence of combined name , abbreviated name , and email alias is normalized to the appropriate candidate_id if there is no ambiguity ; otherwise , the occurrence may be normalized to the candidate_id of a candidate whose full name also appears in the document . 4) All the personal occurrences other than those covered by Heuristic 1) ~ 3) are ignored . Table 2. Heuristic rules for expert extraction As Table 1 demonstrates , it is not an easy task to identify all the masks with regards to an expert . On one hand , the extraction of full name and email address is straightforward but suffers from low coverage . On the other hand , the extraction of 4.1.3 Relation Extraction We focus on extracting relations between topics and expert candidates within a span of a document . To make the extraction easier , we partition a document into a predefined layout . Figure 1 provides a template in Backus?Naur form . Figure 2 provides a practical use of the template . Note that we are not restricting the use of the template only for certain corpus . Actually the template can be applied to many kinds of documents . For example , for web pages , we can construct the < Title > from either the ? title ? metadata or the content of web pages ( Hu et al , 2006). As for email , we can use the ? subject ? field as the < Title>.

Editors : Frank Manola , fmanola@acm.org Eric Miller , W3C , em@w3.org 2. Making Statements About Resources RDF is intended to provide a simple way to make state These capabilities ( the normative specification describe ) 2.1 Basic Concepts Imagine trying to state that someone named John Smith The form of a simple statement such as : < Title > < Author > < Body > < Section Title > < Section > < Section Body > Figure 2. An example use of the layout template With the layout of partitioned documents , we can then explore many types of relations among different blocks . In this paper , we demonstrate the use of five types of relations by extending the study in ( Cao et al , 2005). Section Relation ( RS ): The queried topic and the expert candidate occur in the same < Section >. Windowed Section Relation ( RWS ): The queried topic and the expert candidate occur within a fixed window of a < Section >. In our experiment , we used a window of 200 words . Reference Section Relation ( RRS ): Some < Sec-tion>s should be treated specially . For example , the < Section > consisting of reference information like a list of < book , author > can serve as a reliable source connecting a topic and an expert candidate . We call the relation appearing in a special type of < Section > a special reference section relation . It might be argued whether the use of special sections can be generalized . According to our survey , the special < Section>s can be found in various sites such as Wikipedia as well as W3C . Title-Author Relation ( RTA ): The queried topic appears in the < Title > and the expert candidate appears in the < Author>.
918
Section Title-Body Relation ( RSTB ): The queried topic and the expert candidate appear in the < Section Title > and < Section Body > of the same < Section >, respectively . Reversely , the queried topic and the expert candidate can appear in the < Section Body > and < Section Title > of a < Section >. The latter case is used to characterize the documents introducing certain expert or the expert introducing certain document . Note that our model is not restricted to use these five relations . We use them only for the aim of demonstrating the flexibility and effectiveness of finegrained expert search . 4.2 Evidence Quality Evaluation In this section , we elaborate the mechanism used for evaluating the quality of evidence . 4.2.1 Topic-Matching Quality In Section 4.1.2, we use five techniques in processing query matches , which yield five sets of match types for a given query . Obviously , the different query matches should be associated with different weights because they represent different qualities . We further note that different bigrams generated from the same query with the bigram matching method might also present different qualities . For example , both topic ? css test ? and ? test suite ? are the bigram matching for query ? css test suite ?; however , the former might be more informative . To model that , we use the number of returned documents to refine the query weight . The intuition behind that is similar to the thought of IDF popularly used in IR as we prefer to the distinctive bigrams . Taking into consideration the above two factors , we calculate the topic-matching quality Qt ( corresponding to P(type(t,q )) in Equation (12) ) for the given query q as t tt t df dfMIN qttypeWQ )( )),(( '' = , (13) where t means the discovered topic from a document and type(t,q ) is the matching type between topic t and query q . W(type(t,q )) is the weight for a certain query type , dft is the number of returned documents matched by topic t . In our experiment , we use the 10 training topics of TREC2005 as our training data , and the best quality scores for phrase match , bigram match , proximity match , fuzzy match , and stemmed match are 1, 0.01, 0.05, 108, and 104, respectively . 4.2.2 Person-Matching Quality An expert candidate can occur in the documents in various ways . The most confident occurrence should be the ones in full name or email address . Others can include last name only , last name plus initial of first name , etc . Thus , the action of rejecting or accepting a person from his/her mask ( the surface expression of a person in the text ) is not simply a Boolean decision , but a probabilistic one with a reliability weight Qp ( corresponding to P(c|p ) in Equation (3) ). Similarly , the best trained weights for full name , email name , combined name , abbreviated name , short name , and alias email are set to 1, 1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively . 4.2.3 Relation Type Quality The relation quality consists of two factors . One factor is about the type of the relation . Different types of relations indicate different strength of the connection between expert candidates and queried topics . In our system , the section title-body relation is given the highest confidence . The other factor is about the degree of proximity between a query and an expert candidate . The intuition is that , the more distant are a query and an expert candidate within a relation , the looser the connection between them is . To include these two factors , the quality score Qr ( corresponding to P(type(r )) in Equation (12) ) of a relation r is defined as : 1),( + = tpdis
C
WQ r rr , (14) where Wr is the weight of relation type r , dis(p , t ) is the distance from the person occurrence p to the queried topic t and Cr is a constant for normalization . Again , we optimize the Wr based on the training topics , the best weights for section relation , windowed section relation , reference section relation , title-author relation , and section title-body relation are 1, 4, 10, 45, and 1000 respectively . 4.2.4 Document Quality The quality of evidence also depends on the quality of the document , the context in which it is found . The document context can affect the credibility of the evidence in two ways : 5.1 The Evaluation Data In our experiment , we used the data set in the expert search task of enterprise search track at TREC 2005 and 2006. The document collection is a crawl of the public W3C sites in June 2004. The crawl comprises in total 331,307 web pages . In the following experiments , we used the training set of 10 topics of TREC 2005 for tuning the parameters aforementioned in Section 4.2, and used the test set of 50 topics of TREC 2005 and 49 topics of TREC 2006 as the evaluation data sets . 5.2 Evaluation Metrics We used three measures in evaluation : Mean average precision ( MAP ), R-precision ( RP ), and Top N precision ( P@N ). They are also the standard measures used in the expert search task of TREC . 5.3 Evidence Extraction In the following experiments , we constructed the baseline by using the query matching methods of phrase matching , the expert matching methods of full name matching and email matching , and the relation of section relation . To show the contribution of each individual method for evidence extraction , we incrementally add the methods to the baseline method . In the following description , we will use ?+? to denote applying new method on the previous setting . 5.3.1 Query Matching Table 4 shows the results of expert search achieved by applying different methods of query matching.
QB , QPR , QF , and QS denote bigram match , proximity match , fuzzy match , and stemmed match , respectively . The performance of the proposed model increases stably on MAP when new query matches are added incrementally . We also find that the introduction of QF and QS bring some drop on RPrecision and P@10. It is reasonable because both QF and QS bring high recall while affect the precision a bit . The overall relative improvement of using query matching compared to the baseline is presented in the row ? Improv .?. We performed t-tests on MAP . The p-values (< 0.05) are presented in the ? T-test ? row , which shows that the improvement is statistically significant .

The effects of query matching 5.3.2 Person Matching For person matching , we considered four types of masks , namely combined name ( NC ), abbreviated name ( NA ), short name ( NS ) and alias and new email ( NAE ). Table 5 provides the results on person matching at TREC 2005 and 2006. The baseline is the best model achieved in previous section . It seems that there is little improvement on P@10 while an improvement of 6.21% and 14.00% is observed on MAP . This might be due to the fact that the matching method such as NC has a higher recall but lower precision .

The effects of person matching 5.4 Evidence Quality The performance of expert search can be further improved by considering the evidence quality . Table 7 shows the results by considering the differences in quality . We evaluated two kinds of evidence quality : context static quality ( Qd ) and context dynamic quality ( QDY ). Each of the evidence quality contributes about 1%-2% improvement for MAP . The improvement from the PageRank that we calculated from the corpus implies that the web scaled rank technique is also effective in the corpus of documents . Finally , we find a significant relative improvement of 6.13% and 2.86% on MAP by using evidence qualities .
