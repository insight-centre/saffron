Abstract
Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction ( IE ) require predefined template schemas , and often labeled data , to learn to extract their slot fillers ( e.g ., an embassy is the Target of a Bombing template ). This paper describes an approach to template-based IE that removes this requirement and performs extraction without knowing the template structure in advance . Our algorithm instead learns the template structure automatically from raw text , inducing template schemas as sets of linked events ( e.g ., bombings include detonate , set off , and destroy events ) associated with semantic roles.
We also solve the standard IE task , using the induced syntactic patterns to extract role fillers from specific documents . We evaluate on the MUC4 terrorism dataset and show that we induce template structure very similar to hand-created gold structure , and we extract role fillers with an F1 score of .40, approaching the performance of algorithms that require full knowledge of the templates.
1 Introduction
A template defines a specific type of event ( e.g ., a bombing ) with a set of semantic roles ( or slots ) for the typical entities involved in such an event ( e.g ., perpetrator , target , instrument ). In contrast to work in relation discovery that focuses on learning atomic facts ( Banko et al , 2007a ; Carlson et al , 2010), templates can extract a richer representation of a particular domain . However , unlike relation discovery , most template-based IE approaches assume foreknowledge of the domain?s templates . Very little work addresses how to learn the template structure itself . Our goal in this paper is to perform the standard template filling task , but to first automatically induce the templates from an unlabeled corpus.
There are many ways to represent events , ranging from role-based representations such as frames ( Baker et al , 1998) to sequential events in scripts ( Schank and Abelson , 1977) and narrative schemas ( Chambers and Jurafsky , 2009; Kasch and Oates , 2010). Our approach learns narrative-like knowledge in the form of IE templates ; we learn sets of related events and semantic roles , as shown in this sample output from our system:
Bombing Template { detonate , blow up , plant , explode , defuse , destroy } Perpetrator : Person who detonates , plants , blows up Instrument : Object that is planted , detonated , defused Target : Object that is destroyed , is blown up A semantic role , such as target , is a cluster of syntactic functions of the template?s event words ( e.g ., the objects of detonate and explode ). Our goal is to characterize a domain by learning this template structure completely automatically . We learn templates by first clustering event words based on their proximity in a training corpus . We then use a novel approach to role induction that clusters the syntactic functions of these events based on selectional preferences and coreferring arguments . The induced roles are template-specific ( e.g ., perpetrator ), not universal ( e.g ., agent or patient ) or verb-specific.
After learning a domain?s template schemas , we perform the standard IE task of role filling from individual documents , for example:
Perpetrator : guerrillas
Instrument : dynamite
Target : embassy learned syntactic functions of our roles . We evaluate on the MUC4 terrorism corpus with results approaching those of supervised systems.
The core of this paper focuses on how to characterize a domain-specific corpus by learning rich template structure . We describe how to first expand the small corpus ? size , how to cluster its events , and finally how to induce semantic roles . Section 5 then describes the extraction algorithm , followed by evaluations against previous work in section 6 and 7.
2 Previous Work
Many template extraction algorithms require full knowledge of the templates and labeled corpora , such as in rule-based systems ( Chinchor et al , 1993; Rau et al , 1992) and modern supervised classifiers ( Freitag , 1998; Chieu et al , 2003; Bunescu and Mooney , 2004; Patwardhan and Riloff , 2009).
Classifiers rely on the labeled examples ? surrounding context for features such as nearby tokens , document position , syntax , named entities , semantic classes , and discourse relations ( Maslennikov and Chua , 2007). Ji and Grishman (2008) also supplemented labeled with unlabeled data.
Weakly supervised approaches remove some of the need for fully labeled data . Most still require the templates and their slots . One common approach is to begin with unlabeled , but clustered event-specific documents , and extract common word patterns as extractors ( Riloff and Schmelzenbach , 1998; Sudo et al , 2003; Riloff et al , 2005; Patwardhan and Riloff , 2007). Filatova et al (2006) integrate named entities into pattern learning ( PERSON won ) to approximate unknown semantic roles . Bootstrapping with seed examples of known slot fillers has been shown to be effective ( Surdeanu et al , 2006; Yangarber et al , 2000). In contrast , this paper removes these data assumptions , learning instead from a corpus of unknown events and unclustered documents , without seed examples.
Shinyama and Sekine (2006) describe an approach to template learning without labeled data.
They present unrestricted relation discovery as a means of discovering relations in unlabeled documents , and extract their fillers . Central to the algorithm is collecting multiple documents describing the same exact event ( e.g . Hurricane Ivan ), and observing repeated word patterns across documents connecting the same proper nouns . Learned patterns represent binary relations , and they show how to construct tables of extracted entities for these relations . Our approach draws on this idea of using unlabeled documents to discover relations in text , and of defining semantic roles by sets of entities . However , the limitations to their approach are that (1) redundant documents about specific events are required , (2) relations are binary , and (3) only slots with named entities are learned . We will extend their work by showing how to learn without these assumptions , obviating the need for redundant documents , and learning templates with any type and any number of slots.
Large-scale learning of scripts and narrative schemas also captures template-like knowledge from unlabeled text ( Chambers and Jurafsky , 2008; Kasch and Oates , 2010). Scripts are sets of related event words and semantic roles learned by linking syntactic functions with coreferring arguments . While they learn interesting event structure , the structures are limited to frequent topics in a large corpus . We borrow ideas from this work as well , but our goal is to instead characterize a specific domain with limited data . Further , we are the first to apply this knowledge to the IE task of filling in template mentions in documents.
In summary , our work extends previous work on unsupervised IE in a number of ways . We are the first to learn MUC4 templates , and we are the first to extract entities without knowing how many templates exist , without examples of slot fillers , and without event-clustered documents.
3 The Domain and its Templates
Our goal is to learn the general event structure of a domain , and then extract the instances of each learned event . In order to measure performance in both tasks ( learning structure and extracting instances ), we use the terrorism corpus of MUC4 ( Sundheim , 1991) as our target domain . This corpus was chosen because it is annotated with templates that describe all of the entities involved in each event . An example snippet from a bombing document is given here : town hall . El Comercio reported that alleged Shining Path members also attacked public facilities in huarpacha , Ambo , tomayquichua , and kichki . Municipal official Sergio Horna was seriously wounded in an explosion in
Ambo.
The entities from this document fill the following slots in a MUC4 bombing template.
Perp : Shining Path members Victim : Sergio Horna Target : public facilities Instrument : explosives We focus on these four string-based slots1 from the MUC4 corpus , as is standard in this task . The corpus consists of 1300 documents , 733 of which are labeled with at least one template . There are six types of templates , but only four are modestly frequent : bombing (208 docs ), kidnap (83 docs ), attack (479 docs ), and arson (40 docs ). 567 documents do not have any templates . Our learning algorithm does not know which documents contain ( or do not contain ) which templates . After learning event words that represent templates , we induce their slots , not knowing a priori how many there are , and then fill them in by extracting entities as in the standard task.
In our example above , the three bold verbs ( use , attack , wound ) indicate the Bombing template , and their syntactic arguments fill its slots.
4 Learning Templates from Raw Text
Our goal is to learn templates that characterize a domain as described in unclustered , unlabeled documents . This presents a twofold problem to the learner : it does not know how many events exist , and it does not know which documents describe which event ( some may describe multiple events ). We approach this problem with a three step process : (1) cluster the domain?s event patterns to approximate the template topics , (2) build a new corpus specific to each cluster by retrieving documents from a larger unrelated corpus , (3) induce each template?s slots using its new ( larger ) corpus of documents.
4.1 Clustering Events to Learn Templates We cluster event patterns to create templates . An event pattern is either (1) a verb , (2) a noun in Word-1There are two Perpetrator slots in MUC4: Organization and Individual . We consider their union as a single slot.
Net under the Event synset , or (3) a verb and the head word of its syntactic object . Examples of each include (1) ? explode ?, (2) ? explosion ?, and (3) ? ex-plode:bomb ?. We also tag the corpus with an NER system and allow patterns to include named entity types , e.g ., ? kidnap:PERSON ?. These patterns are crucially needed later to learn a template?s slots.
However , we first need an algorithm to cluster these patterns to learn the domain?s core events . We consider two unsupervised algorithms : Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ( Blei et al , 2003), and agglomerative clustering based on word distance.
4.1.1 LDA for Unknown Data
LDA is a probabilistic model that treats documents as mixtures of topics . It learns topics as discrete distributions ( multinomials ) over the event patterns , and thus meets our needs as it clusters patterns based on cooccurrence in documents . The algorithm requires the number of topics to be known ahead of time , but in practice this number is set relatively high and the resulting topics are still useful . Our best performing LDA model used 200 topics . We had mixed success with LDA though , and ultimately found our next approach performed slightly better on the document classification evaluation.
4.1.2 Clustering on Event Distance
Agglomerative clustering does not require foreknowledge of the templates , but its success relies on how event pattern similarity is determined.
Ideally , we want to learn that detonate and destroy belong in the same cluster representing a bombing.
Vector-based approaches are often adopted to represent words as feature vectors and compute their distance with cosine similarity . Unfortunately , these approaches typically learn clusters of synonymous words that can miss detonate and destroy . Our goal is to instead capture world knowledge of cooccuring events . We thus adopt an assumption that closeness in the world is reflected by closeness in a text?s discourse . We hypothesize that two patterns are related if they occur near each other in a document more often than chance.
Let g(wi , wj ) be the distance between two events (1 if in the same sentence , 2 in neighboring , etc ). Let Cdist(wi , wj ) be the distance-weighted frequency of ping , ransom , robbery , registration bombing : explode , blow up , locate , place:bomb , detonate , damage , explosion , cause , damage , ...
attack : kill , shoot down , down , kill:civilian , kill:PER , kill:soldier , kill:member , killing , shoot:PER , wave , ...
arson : burn , search , burning , clip , collaborate , ...
Figure 1: The 4 clusters mapped to MUC4 templates.
two events occurring together:
Cdist(wi , wj ) = ? d?D ? wi,wj?d 1? log4(g(wi , wj )) (1) where d is a document in the set of all documents D . The base 4 logarithm discounts neighboring sentences by 0.5 and within the same sentence scores 1.
Using this definition of distance , pointwise mutual information measures our similarity of two events : pmi(wi , wj ) = Pdist(wi , wj)/(P ( wi)P ( wj )) (2)
P ( wi ) =
C(wi ) ? j C(wj ) (3)
Pdist(wi , wj ) =
Cdist(wi , wj ) ? k ? l Cdist(wk , wl ) (4)
We run agglomerative clustering with pmi over all event patterns . Merging decisions use the average link score between all new links across two clusters.
As with all clustering algorithms , a stopping criterion is needed . We continue merging clusters until any single cluster grows beyond m patterns . We briefly inspected the clustering process and chose m = 40 to prevent learned scenarios from intuitively growing too large and ambiguous . Postevaluation analysis shows that this value has wide flexibility.
For example , the Kidnap and Arson clusters are unchanged in 30 < m < 80, and Bombing unchanged in 30 < m < 50. Figure 1 shows 3 clusters ( of 77 learned ) that characterize the main template types.
4.2 Information Retrieval for Templates
Learning a domain often suffers from a lack of training data . The previous section clustered events from the MUC4 corpus , but its 1300 documents do not provide enough examples of verbs and argument counts to further learn the semantic roles in each cluster . Our solution is to assemble a larger IR-corpus of documents for each cluster . For example , MUC4 labels 83 documents with Kidnap , but our learned cluster ( kidnap , abduct , release , ...) retrieved 3954 documents from a general corpus.
We use the Associated Press and New York Times sections of the Gigaword Corpus ( Graff , 2002) as our general corpus . These sections include approximately 3.5 million news articles spanning 12 years.
Our retrieval algorithm retrieves documents that score highly with a cluster?s tokens . The document score is defined by two common metrics : word match , and word coverage . A document?s match score is defined as the average number of times the words in cluster c appear in document d : avgm(d , c ) = ? w?c ? t?d 1{w = t } | c | (5) We define word coverage as the number of seen cluster words . Coverage penalizes documents that score highly by repeating a single cluster word a lot.
We only score a document if its coverage , cvg(d , c ), is at least 3 words ( or less for tiny clusters ): ir(d , c ) = { avgm(d , c ) if cvg(d , c ) > min(3, | c|/4) 0 otherwise A document d is retrieved for a cluster c if ir(d , c ) > 0.4. Finally , we emphasize precision by pruning away 50% of a cluster?s retrieved documents that are farthest in distance from the mean document of the retrieved set . Distance is the cosine similarity between bag-of-words vector representations . The confidence value of 0.4 was chosen from a manual inspection among a single cluster?s retrieved documents . Pruning 50% was arbitrarily chosen to improve precision , and we did not experiment with other quantities . A search for optimum parameter values may lead to better results.
4.3 Inducing Semantic Roles ( Slots)
Having successfully clustered event words and retrieved an IR-corpus for each cluster , we now address the problem of inducing semantic roles . Our learned roles will then extract entities in the next section and we will evaluate their per-role accuracy.
Most work on unsupervised role induction focuses on learning verb-specific roles , starting with seed examples ( Swier and Stevenson , 2004; He and ( Grenager and Manning , 2006; Lang and Lapata , 2010). Our previous work ( Chambers and Jurafsky , 2009) learned situation-specific roles over narrative schemas , similar to frame roles in FrameNet ( Baker et al , 1998). Schemas link the syntactic relations of verbs by clustering them based on observing coreferring arguments in those positions . This paper extends this intuition by introducing a new vector-based approach to coreference similarity.
4.3.1 Syntactic Relations as Roles
We learn the roles of cluster C by clustering the syntactic relations RC of its words . Consider the following example : C = { go off , explode , set off , damage , destroy } RC = { go off:s , go off:p in , explode:s , set off:s } where verb:s is the verb?s subject , : o the object , and p in a preposition . We ideally want to cluster RC as : bomb = { go off:s , explode:s , set off:o , destroy:s } suspect = { set off:s } target = { go off:p in , destroy:o } We want to cluster all subjects , objects , and prepositions . Passive voice is normalized to active2.
We adopt two views of relation similarity : coreferring arguments and selectional preferences.
Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) observed that coreferring arguments suggest a semantic relation between two predicates . In the sentence , he ran and then he fell , the subjects of run and fall corefer , and so they likely belong to the same scenario-specific semantic role . We applied this idea to a new vector similarity framework . We represent a relation as a vector of all relations with which their arguments coreferred . For instance , arguments of the relation go off:s were seen coreferring with mentions in plant:o , set off:o and injure:s . We represent go off:s as a vector of these relation counts , calling this its coref vector representation.
Selectional preferences ( SPs ) are also useful in measuring similarity ( Erk and Pado , 2008). A relation can be represented as a vector of its observed arguments during training . The SPs for go off:s in our data include { bomb , device , charge , explosion}.
We measure similarity using cosine similarity between the vectors in both approaches . However , 2We use the Stanford Parser at nlp.stanford.edu/software coreference and SPs measure different types of similarity . Coreference is a looser narrative similarity ( bombings cause injuries ), while SPs capture synonymy ( plant and place have similar arguments ). We observed that many narrative relations are not synonymous , and vice versa . We thus take the maximum of either cosine score as our final similarity metric between two relations . We then back off to the average of the two cosine scores if the max is not confident ( less than 0.7); the average penalizes the pair . We chose the value of 0.7 from a grid search to optimize extraction results on the training set.
4.3.2 Clustering Syntactic Functions
We use agglomerative clustering with the above pairwise similarity metric . Cluster similarity is the average link score over all new links crossing two clusters . We include the following sparsity penalty r(ca , cb ) if there are too few links between clusters ca and cb.
score(ca , cb ) = ? wi?ca ? wj?cb sim(wi , wj)?r(ca , cb ) (6) r(ca , cb ) = ? wi?ca ? wj?cb 1{sim(wi , wj ) > 0} ? wi?ca ? wj?cb This penalizes clusters from merging when they share only a few high scoring edges . Clustering stops when the merged cluster scores drop below a threshold optimized to extraction performance on the training data.
We also begin with two assumptions about syntactic functions and semantic roles . The first assumes that the subject and object of a verb carry different semantic roles . For instance , the subject of sell fills a different role ( Seller ) than the object ( Good ). The second assumption is that each semantic role has a high-level entity type . For instance , the subject of sell is a Person or Organization , and the object is a
Physical Object.
We implement the first assumption as a constraint in the clustering algorithm , preventing two clusters from merging if their union contains the same verb?s subject and object.
We implement the second assumption by automatically labeling each syntactic function with a role type based on its observed arguments . The role types are broad general classes : Person/Org , Physical Object , or Other . A syntactic function is labeled as a Perpetrator Person/Org who detonates , blows up , plants , hurls , stages , is detained , is suspected , is blamed on , launches Instrument A physical object that is exploded , explodes , is hurled , causes , goes off , is planted , damages , is set off , is defused Target A physical object that is damaged , is destroyed , is exploded at , is damaged , is thrown at , is hit , is struck Police Person/Org who raids , questions , discovers , investigates , defuses , arrests N/A A physical object that is blown up , destroys
Attack/Shooting Template ( MUC4)
Perpetrator Person/Org who assassinates , patrols , ambushes , raids , shoots , is linked to Victim Person/Org who is assassinated , is toppled , is gunned down , is executed , is evacuated Target Person/Org who is hit , is struck , is downed , is set fire to , is blown up , surrounded Instrument A physical object that is fired , injures , downs , is set off , is exploded
Kidnap Template ( MUC4)
Perpetrator Person/Org who releases , abducts , kidnaps , ambushes , holds , forces , captures , is imprisoned , frees Target Person/Org who is kidnapped , is released , is freed , escapes , disappears , travels , is harmed , is threatened Police Person/Org who rules out , negotiates , condemns , is pressured , finds , arrests , combs
Weapons Smuggling Template ( NEW)
Perpetrator Person/Org who smuggles , is seized from , is captured , is detained Police Person/Org who raids , seizes , captures , confiscates , detains , investigates Instrument A physical object that is smuggled , is seized , is confiscated , is transported
Election Template ( NEW)

class if 20% of its arguments appear under the corresponding WordNet synset3, or if the NER system labels them as such . Once labeled by type , we separately cluster the syntactic functions for each role type . For instance , Person functions are clustered separate from Physical Object functions . Figure 2 shows some of the resulting roles.
Finally , since agglomerative clustering makes hard decisions , related events to a template may have been excluded in the initial event clustering stage.
To address this problem , we identify the 200 nearby events to each event cluster . These are simply the top scoring event patterns with the cluster?s original events . We add their syntactic functions to their best matching roles . This expands the coverage of each learned role . Varying the 200 amount does not lead to wide variation in extraction performance . Once induced , the roles are evaluated by their entity extraction performance in Section 5.
4.4 Template Evaluation
We now compare our learned templates to those hand-created by human annotators for the MUC4 terrorism corpus . The corpus contains 6 template 3Physical objects are defined as non-person physical objects

types , but two of them occur in only 4 and 14 of the 1300 training documents . We thus only evaluate the 4 main templates ( bombing , kidnapping , attack , and arson ). The gold slots are shown in figure 3.
We evaluate the four learned templates that score highest in the document classification evaluation ( to be described in section 5.1), aligned with their MUC4 types . Figure 2 shows three of our four templates , and two brand new ones that our algorithm learned . Of the four templates , we learned 12 of the 13 semantic roles as created for MUC . In addition , we learned a new role not in MUC for bombings , kidnappings , and arson : the Police or Authorities role . The annotators chose not to include this in their labeling , but this knowledge is clearly relevant when understanding such events , so we consider it correct.
There is one additional Bombing and one Arson role that does not align with MUC4, marked incorrect.
981
We thus report 92% slot recall , and precision as 14 of 16 (88%) learned slots.
We only measure agreement with the MUC template schemas , but our system learns other events as well . We show two such examples in figure 2: the Weapons Smuggling and Election Templates.
5 Information Extraction : Slot Filling
We now present how to apply our learned templates to information extraction . This section will describe how to extract slot fillers using our templates , but without knowing which templates are correct.
We could simply use a standard IE approach , for example , creating seed words for our new learned templates . But instead , we propose a new method that obviates the need for even a limited human labeling of seed sets . We consider each learned semantic role as a potential slot , and we extract slot fillers using the syntactic functions that were previously learned . Thus , the learned syntactic patterns ( e.g ., the subject of release ) serve the dual purpose of both inducing the template slots , and extracting appropriate slot fillers from text.
5.1 Document Classification
A document is labeled for a template if two different conditions are met : (1) it contains at least one trigger phrase , and (2) its average per-token conditional probability meets a strict threshold.
Both conditions require a definition of the conditional probability of a template given a token . The conditional is defined as the token?s importance relative to its uniqueness across all templates . This is not the usual conditional probability definition as
IR-corpora are different sizes.
P ( t|w ) =
PIRt(w )? s?T PIRs(w ) (8) where PIRt(w ) is the probability of pattern w in the
IR-corpus of template t.
PIRt(w ) =
Ct(w ) ? v Ct(v ) (9) where Ct(w ) is the number of times word w appears in the IR-corpus of template t . A template?s trigger words are defined as words satisfying P ( t|w ) > 0.2.

Figure 4: Document classification results on test.
Trigger phrases are thus template-specific patterns that are highly indicative of that template.
After identifying triggers , we use the above definition to score a document with a template . A document is labeled with a template if it contains at least one trigger , and its average word probability is greater than a parameter optimized on the training set . A document can be ( and often is ) labeled with multiple templates.
Finally , we label the sentences that contain triggers and use them for extraction in section 5.2.
5.1.1 Experiment : Document Classification The MUC4 corpus links templates to documents , allowing us to evaluate our document labels . We treat each link as a gold label ( kidnap , bomb , or attack ) for that document , and documents can have multiple labels . Our learned clusters naturally do not have MUC labels , so we report results on the four clusters that score highest with each label.
Figure 4 shows the document classification scores . The bombing template performs best with an F1 score of .72. Arson occurs very few times , and Attack is lower because it is essentially an agglomeration of diverse events ( discussed later).
5.2 Entity Extraction
Once documents are labeled with templates , we next extract entities into the template slots . Extraction occurs in the trigger sentences from the previous section . The extraction process is twofold : 1. Extract all NPs that are arguments of patterns in the template?s induced roles.
2. Extract NPs whose heads are observed frequently with one of the roles ( e.g ., ? bomb ? is seen with Instrument relations in figure 2).
Take the following MUC4 sentence as an example : The two bombs were planted with the exclusive purpose of intimidating the owners of...
982
The verb plant is in our learned bombing cluster , so step (1) will extract its passive subject bombs and map it to the correct instrument role ( see figure 2).
The human target , owners , is missed because intimidate was not learned . However , if owner is in the selectional preferences of the learned ? human target ? role , step (2) correctly extracts it into that role.
These are two different , but complementary , views of semantic roles . The first is that a role is defined by the set of syntactic relations that describe it.
Thus , we find all role relations and save their arguments ( pattern extraction ). The second view is that a role is defined by the arguments that fill it . Thus , we extract all arguments that filled a role in training , regardless of their current syntactic environment.
Finally , we filter extractions whose WordNet or named entity label does not match the learned slot?s type ( e.g ., a Location does not match a Person).
6 Standard Evaluation
We trained on the 1300 documents in the MUC4 corpus and tested on the 200 document TST3 and TST4 test set . We evaluate the four string-based slots : perpetrator , physical target , human target , and instrument . We merge MUC?s two perpetrator slots ( individuals and orgs ) into one gold Perpetrator slot.
As in Patwardhan and Riloff (2007; 2009), we ignore missed optional slots in computing recall . We induced clusters in training , performed IR , and induced the slots . We then extracted entities from the test documents as described in section 5.2.
The standard evaluation for this corpus is to report the F1 score for slot type accuracy , ignoring the template type . For instance , a perpetrator of a bombing and a perpetrator of an attack are treated the same.
This allows supervised classifiers to train on all perpetrators at once , rather than template-specific learners . Although not ideal for our learning goals , we report it for comparison against previous work.
Several supervised approaches have presented results on MUC4, but unfortunately we cannot compare against them . Maslennikov and Chua (2006; 2007) evaluated a random subset of test ( they report .60 and .63 F1), and Xiao et al (2004) did not evaluate all slot types ( they report .57 F1).
Figure 5 thus shows our results with previous work that is comparable : the fully supervised and

weakly supervised approaches of Patwardhan and Riloff (2009; 2007). We give two numbers for our system : mapping one learned template to Attack , and mapping five . Our learned templates for Attack have a different granularity than MUC4. Rather than one broad Attack type , we learn several : Shooting , Murder , Coup , General Injury , and Pipeline Attack . We see these subtypes as strengths of our algorithm , but it misses the MUC4 granularity of Attack . We thus show results when we apply the best five learned templates to Attack , rather than just one.
The final F1 with these Attack subtypes is .40.
Our precision is as good as ( and our F1 score near ) two algorithms that require knowledge of the templates and/or labeled data . Our algorithm instead learned this knowledge without such supervision.
7 Specific Evaluation
In order to more precisely evaluate each learned template , we also evaluated per-template performance . Instead of merging all slots across all template types , we score the slots within each template type . This is a stricter evaluation than Section 6; for example , bombing victims assigned to attacks were previously deemed correct4.
Figure 6 gives our results . Three of the four templates score at or above .42 F1, showing that our lower score from the previous section is mainly due to the Attack template . Arson also unexpectedly 4We do not address the task of template instance identification ( e.g ., splitting two bombings into separate instances ). This requires deeper discourse analysis not addressed by this paper.

scored well . It only occurs in 40 documents overall , suggesting our algorithm works with little evidence.
Per-template performace is good , and our .40 overall score from the previous section illustrates that we perform quite well in comparison to the .44-.53 range of weakly and fully supervised results.
These evaluations use the standard TST3 and TST4 test sets , including the documents that are not labeled with any templates . 74 of the 200 test documents are unlabeled . In order to determine where the system?s false positives originate , we also measure performance only on the 126 test documents that have at least one template . Figure 7 presents the results on this subset . Kidnap improves most significantly in F1 score (7 F1 points absolute ), but the others only change slightly . Most of the false positives in the system thus do not originate from the unlabeled documents ( the 74 unlabeled ), but rather from extracting incorrect entities from correctly identified documents ( the 126 labeled).
8 Discussion
Template-based IE systems typically assume knowledge of the domain and its templates . We began by showing that domain knowledge isn?t necessarily required ; we learned the MUC4 template structure with surprising accuracy , learning new semantic roles and several new template structures . We are the first to our knowledge to automatically induce MUC4 templates . It is possible to take these learned slots and use a previous approach to IE ( such as seed-based bootstrapping ), but we presented an algorithm that instead uses our learned syntactic patterns . We achieved results with comparable precision , and an F1 score of .40 that approaches prior algorithms that rely on handcrafted knowledge.
The extraction results are encouraging , but the template induction itself is a central contribution of this work . Knowledge induction plays an important role in moving to new domains and assisting users who may not know what a corpus contains . Recent work in Open IE learns atomic relations ( Banko et al , 2007b ), but little work focuses on structured scenarios . We learned more templates than just the main MUC4 templates . A user who seeks to know what information is in a body of text would instantly recognize these as key templates , and could then extract the central entities.
We hope to address in the future how the al-gorithm?s unsupervised nature hurts recall . Without labeled or seed examples , it does not learn as many patterns or robust classifiers as supervised approaches . We will investigate new text sources and algorithms to try and capture more knowledge . The final experiment in figure 7 shows that perhaps new work should first focus on pattern learning and entity extraction , rather than document identification.
Finally , while our pipelined approach ( template induction with an IR stage followed by entity extraction ) has the advantages of flexibility in development and efficiency , it does involve a number of parameters . We believe the IR parameters are quite robust , and did not heavily focus on improving this stage , but the two clustering steps during template induction require parameters to control stopping conditions and word filtering . While all learning algorithms require parameters , we think it is important for future work to focus on removing some of these to help the algorithm be even more robust to new domains and genres.
