Abstract
In this paper I present a Master?s thesis proposal in syntaxbased Statistical Machine Translation . I propose to build discriminative SMT models using both tree-to-string and tree-to-tree approaches . Translation and language models will be represented mainly through the use of Tree Automata and Tree
Transducers . These formalisms have important representational properties that makes them well-suited for syntax modeling . I also present an experiment plan to evaluate these models through the use of a parallel corpus written in English and Brazilian Portuguese.
1 Introduction
Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) has dominated Machine Translation ( MT ) research in the last two decades . One of its variants , Phrase-based SMT ( PBSMT ), is currently considered the state of the art in the area . However , since the advent of PBSMT by Koehn et al (2003) and Och and Ney (2004), purely statistical MT systems have not achieved considerable improvements . So , new research directions point toward the use of linguistic resources integrated into SMT systems.
According to Lopez (2008), there are four steps when building an SMT system : translational equivalence modeling1, parameterization , parameter estimation and decoding . This Master?s thesis proposal aims to improve SMT systems by including syntactic information in the first and second steps . There-1For the remainder of this proposal , I will refer to this step as simply translation model.
fore , I plan to investigate two approaches : the Tree-to-String ( TTS ) and the Tree-to-Tree ( TTT ) models.
In the former , syntactic information is provided only for the source language while in the latter , it is provided for both source and target languages.
There are many formal theories to represent syntax in a language , like Context-free Grammars ( CFGs ), Tree Substitution Grammars ( TSGs ), Tree Adjoining Grammars ( TAGs ) and all its synchronous counterparts . In this work , I represent each sentence as a constituent tree and use Tree Automata ( TAs ) and Tree Transducers ( TTs ) in the language and translation models.
Although this work is mainly language independent , proof-of-concept experiments will be executed on the English and Brazilian Portuguese ( en-ptBR ) language pair . Previous research on factored translation for this pair ( using morphological information ) showed that it improved the results in terms of BLEU ( Papineni et al , 2001) and NIST ( Doddington , 2002) scores , as shown in Table 1 ( Caseli and Nunes , 2009). However , even factored translation models have limitations : many languages ( and Brazilian Portuguese is not an exception ) have relatively loose word order constraints and present long-distance agreements that cannot be efficiently represented by those models . Such phenomena motivate the use of more powerful models that take syntactic information into account.

Galley et al (2006) also uses transducer rules but extract them from parse trees in target language instead ( the string-to-tree approach - STT ). Works that apply the TTT model include Gildea (2003) and Zhang et al (2008). All those works also include methods and algorithms for efficient rule extraction since it?s unfeasible to extract all possible rules from a parsed corpus due to exponential cost.
There have been research efforts to combine syntaxbased systems with phrasebased systems.
These works mainly try to incorporate non-syntatic phrases into a syntaxbased model : while Liu et al (2006) integrates bilingual phrase tables as separate TTS templates , Zhang et al (2008) uses an algorithm to convert leaves in a parse tree to phrases before rule extraction.
Language models that take into account syntactic aspects have also been an active research subject.
While works like Post and Gildea (2009) and Vandeghinste (2009) focus solely on language modeling itself , Graham and van Genabith (2010) shows an experiment that incorporates a syntaxbased model into an PBSMT system.
3 Tree automata and tree transducers
Tree Automata are similar to Finitestate Automata ( FSA ), except they recognize trees instead of strings ( or sequences of words ). Formally , FSA can only represent Regular Languages and thus , cannot efficiently model several syntactic features , including long-distance agreement . TA recognize the socalled Regular Tree Languages ( RTLs ), which can represent Context-free Languages ( CFLs ) since a set of all syntactic trees of a CFL is an RTL ( Comon et al , 2007). However , it is important to note that the reciprocal is not true : there are RTLs that cannot be modeled by a CFL because those cannot capture the inner structure of trees . Figure 1 shows such an RTL , composed of two trees . If we extract an CFG from this RTL it would have the recursive rule S ? SS , which would generate an infinite set of syntactic trees . In other words , there isn?t an CFG capable to generate only the syntactic trees contained in the RTL shown in Figure 1. This feature implies that RTLs have more representational power than CFLs.

Figure 1: An RTL that cannot be modeled by a CFL As a Finitestate Transducer ( FST ) is an extension of an FSA that produces strings , a Tree Transducer is an extension of a TA that produces trees . An FST is composed by an input RTL , an output RTL and a set of transformation rules . Restrictions can be added to the rules , leading to many TT variations , each with its properties ( Graehl et al , 2008). The variations studied in this work are the xT ( extended topdown , for TTT models ) and xTS ( extended topdown tree-to-string , for TTS models).
Top-down ( T ) transducers processes input trees starting from its root and descending through its nodes until it reaches the leaves , in contrast to bottom-up transducers , which do the opposite . Figure 2 shows a T rule , where uppercase letters ( NP ) represent symbols , lowercase letters ( q , r , s ) represent states and x1 and x2 are variables ( formal definitions can be found in Comon et al (2007)). Default topdown transducers must have only one symbol on the lefthand sides and thus cannot model some syntactic transformations ( like local reordering , for example ) without relying on copy and delete operations ( Maletti et al , 2009). Extended topdown transducers allow multiple symbols on lefthand sides , making them more suited for syntax modeling . This property is shown on Figure 3 ( adapted from Maletti et al (2009)). Tree-to-string transducers simply drop the tree structure on right-tion models wihtout syntactic information in one of the languages . Figure 4 shows an example of a xTS rule , applied for the en-ptBR pair.

Settings that uses more features besides those two models will also be built . In particular , I will investigate settings that incorporate nonsyntactic phrases , using methods similar to Liu et al (2006) and Zhang et al (2008) The translation models will be weighted TTs ( Graehl et al , 2008), which add probabilities to the rules . These probabilities will be learned by an EM algorithm similar to the one described in Graehl et al . (2008). Rule extraction for TTS will be similar to the GHKM algorithm described in Galley et al (2004) but I also plan to investigate the approaches used by Liu et al (2006) and Nguyen et al (2008).
For TTT rule extraction , I will use a method similar to the one described in Zhang et al (2008).
I also plan to use language models which takes into account syntactic properties . Although most works in syntactic language models uses tree grammars like TSGs and TAGs , these can be simulated by TAs and TTs ( Shieber , 2004; Maletti , 2010). This property can help the systems implementation because it?s possible to unite language and translation modeling in one TT toolkit.

Figure 3: Example of a xT rule and its corresponding T rules 5.1 Materials To implement and evaluate the techniques described , a parallel corpus with syntactic annotation is required . As the focus of this thesis is the English and Brazilian Portuguese language pair , I will use the PesquisaFAPESP corpus2 in my experiments . This corpus is composed of 646 scientific papers , originally written in Brazilian Portuguese and manually translated into English , resulting in about 17,000 parallel sentences . As for syntactic annotation , I will use the Berkeley parser ( Petrov and Klein , 2007) for 2http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br

In addition to the corpora and parsers , the following tools will be used : ? GIZA++3 ( Och and Ney , 2000) for lexical alignment ? Tiburon4 ( May and Knight , 2006) for transducer training in both TTS and TTT systems ? Moses5 ( Koehn et al , 2007) for decoding 5.2 Experiments and evaluation Initially the corpus will be parsed using the tools described in section 5.1 and divided into a training set and a test set . For the TTS systems ( one for each translation direction ), the training set will be lexically aligned using GIZA ++ and for the TTT system , its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniques similar to the ones proposed by Gildea (2003) and by Zhang et al (2008). Both TTS and TTT systems will be implemented using Tiburon and Moses . For evaluation , BLEU and NIST scores on the test set will be used . The baseline will be the score for factored translation , shown in Table 1.
