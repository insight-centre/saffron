We address appropriate user modeling in order to generate cooperative responses to each user in spoken dialogue systems  . Unlike previous studies that focus on user?s knowledge or typical kinds of users  , the user model we propose is more comprehensive . Specifically , we set up three dimensions of user models : skill level to the system  , knowledge level on the target domain and the degree of hastiness  . 
Moreover , the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using real dialogue data collected by the system  . We obtained reasonable classification accuracy for all dimensions  . Dialogue strategies based on the user modeling are implemented in Kyoto city bus information system that has been developed at our laboratory  . Experimental evaluation shows that the cooperative responses adaptive to individual users serve as good guidance for novice users without increasing the dialogue duration for skilled users  . 
1 Introduction
A spoken dialogue system is one of the promising applications of the speech recognition and natural language understanding technologies  . A typical task of spoken dialogue systems is database retrieval  . 
Some IVR ( interactive voice response ) systems using the speech recognition technology are being put into practical use as its simplest form  . According to the spread of cellular phones , spoken dialogue systems via telephone enable us to obtain information from various places without any other special appa-ratuses  . 
However , the speech interface involves two inevitable problems : one is speech recognition errors  , and the other is that much information cannot be conveyed at once in speech communications  . 
Therefore , the dialogue strategies , which determine when to make guidance and what the system should tell to the user  , are the essential factors . To cope with speech recognition errors , several confirmation strategies have been proposed : confirmation management methods based on confidence measures of speech recognition results  ( Komatani and Kawahara , 2000; Hazen et al ,  2000 ) and implicit confirmation that includes previous recognition results into system?s prompts  ( Sturm et al ,  1999) . In terms of determining what to say to the user , several studies have been done not only to output answers corresponding to user?s questions but also to generate cooperative responses  ( Sadek ,  1999) . Furthermore , methods have also been proposed to change the dialogue initiative based on various cues  ( Litman and Pan , 2000; Chu-Carroll , 2000; Lamel et al ,  1999) . 
Nevertheless , whether a particular response is cooperative or not depends on individual user?s characteristics  . For example , when a user says nothing , the appropriate response should be different whether he/she is not accustomed to using the spoken dialogue systems or he/she does not know much about the target domain  . Unless we detect the cause of the silence , the system may fall into the same situation repeatedly  . 
In order to adapt the system?s behavior to individual users  , it is necessary to model the user?s patterns ( Kass and Finin ,  1988) . Most of conventional studies on user models have focused on the knowledge of users  . Others tried to infer and utilize user?s goals to generate responses adapted to the user  ( van Beek , 1987; Paris ,  1988) . Elzer et al ( 2000 ) proposed a method to generate adaptive suggestions according to users ? preferences  . 
However , these studies depend on knowledge of the target domain greatly  , and therefore the user models need to be deliberated manually to be applied to new domains  . Moreover , they assumed that the input is text only , which does not contain errors . 
On the other hand , spoken utterances include various information such as the interval between utterances  , the presence of barge-in and so on , which can be utilized to judge the user?s character  . These features also possess generality in spoken dialogue systems because they are not dependent on domain-specific knowledge  . 
We propose more comprehensive user models to generate user-adapted responses in spoken dialogue systems taking account of all available information specific to spoken dialogue  . The models change both the dialogue initiative and the generated response  . In ( Eckert et al ,  1997) , typical users ? behaviors are defined to evaluate spoken dialogue systems by simulation  , and stereotypes of users are assumed such as patient  , submissive and experienced . 
We introduce user models not for defining users ? behaviors beforehand  , but for detecting users ? patterns in realtime interaction  . 
We define three dimensions in the user models : ? skill level to the system ?  , ? knowledge level on the target domain ? and ? degree of hastiness ?  . The former two are related to the strategies in management of the initiative and the response generation  . 
These two enable the system to adaptively generate dialogue management information and domain -specific information  , respectively . The last one is used to manage the situation when users are in hurry  . 
Namely , it controls generation of the additive contents based on the former two user models  . Handling such a situation becomes more crucial in speech communications using cellular phones  . 
The user models are trained by decision tree Sys : Please tell me your current bus stop  , your destination or the specific bus route . 
User : Shijo-Kawaramachi.
Sys : Do you take abus from Shijo-Kawaramachi ?
User : Yes.
Sys : Where will you get off the bus ?
User : Arashiyama.
Sys : Do yougo from Shijo-Kawara machito Arashiyama ? 
User : Yes.
Sys:Bus number 11 bound for Arashiyama has departed
Sanjo-Keihanmae , two bus stops away.
Figure 1: Example dialogue of the bus system learning algorithm using real data collected from the Kyotocity bus information system  . Then , we implement the user models and adaptive dialogue strategies on the system and evaluate them using data collected with  20 novice users . 
2Kyoto City Bus Information System
We have developed the Kyoto City Bus Information System  , which locates the busauser wants to take , and tells him/her how long it will take before its arrival  . The system can be accessed via telephone including cellular  phones1  . From any places , users can easily get the businformation that changes every minute  . Users are requested to input the buss top to get on  , the destination , or the busroute number by speech , and get the corresponding bus information . The bus stops can be specified by the name of famous places or public facilities nearby  . Figure 1 shows a simple example of the dialogue . 
Figure 2 shows an overview of the system.
The system operates by generating VoiceXML scripts dynamically  . The realtime bus information database is provided on the Web  , and can be accessed via Internet . Then , we explain the modules in the following . 
VWS ( Voice Web Server)
The Voice Web Server drives the speech recognition engine and the TTS  ( Text-To-Speech ) module according to the specifications by the generated VoiceXML  . 
Speech Recognizer
The speech recognizer decodes user utterances 1+81-75-326-3116 VWS ( Voice Web Server ) response sentences recognition results ( only language info . ) recognition results ( including features other than language info . ) VoiceXML user

Voice XML generator dialogue manager user profiles real bus information user model identifier 
CGI the system except for proposed user models Figure  2: Overview of the bus system with user models based on specified grammar rules and vocabulary  , which are defined by VoiceXML at each dialogue state  . 
Dialogue Manager
The dialogue manager generates response sentences based on speech recognition results  ( bus stop names or a route number ) received from the VWS . If sufficient information to locate abus is obtained  , it retrieves the corresponding information from the realtime bus information database  . 
Voice XML Generator
This module dynamically generates Voice XML files that contain response sentences and specifications of speech recognition grammars  , which are given by the dialogue manager . 
User Model Identifier
This module classifies user?s characters based on the user models using features specific to spoken dialogue as well as semantic attributes  . 
The obtained user profiles are sent to the dialogue manager  , and are utilized in the dialogue management and response generation  . 
3 Response Generation using User Models 3 . 1 Classification of User Models We define three dimensions as user models listed below  . 
 Skill level to the system  Knowledge level on the target domain  Degree of hastiness 
Skill Level to the System
Since spoken dialogue systems are not widespread yet  , there arises a difference in the skill level of users in operating the systems  . It is desirable that the system changes its behavior including response generation and initiative management in accordance with the skill level of the user  . In conventional systems , a system-initiated guidance has been invoked on the spur of the moment either when the user says nothing or when speech recognition is not successful  . In our framework , by modeling the skill level as the user?s property  , we address a radical solution for the unskilled users  . 
Knowledge Level on the Target Domain
There also exists a difference in the knowledge level on the target domain among users  . Thus , it is necessary for the system to change information to present to users  . For example , it is not cooperative to tell too detailed information to strangers  . On the other hand , for inhabitants , it is useful to omit too obvious information and to output additive information  . Therefore , we introduce a dimension that represents the knowledge level on the target domain  . 
Degree of Hastiness
In speech communications , it is more important to present information promptly and concisely compared with the other communication modes such as browsing  . Especially in the bus system , the conciseness is preferred because the bus information is urgent to most users  . Therefore , we also take account of degree of hastiness of the user  , and accordingly change the system?s responses . 
3.2 Response Generation Strategy using User

Next , we describe the response generation strategies adapted to individual users based on the proposed user models : skill level  , knowledge level and hasti-ness . Basic design of dialogue management is based on mixed-initiative dialogue  , in which the system makes follow up questions and guidance if necessary while allowing a user to utter freely  . It is investigated to add various contents to the system responses as cooperative responses in  ( Sadek ,  1999) . 
Such additive information is usually cooperative , but some people may feel such a response redundant  . 
Thus , we introduce the user models and control the generation of additive information  . By introducing the proposed user models , the system changes generated responses by the following two aspects : dialogue procedure and contents of responses  . 
Dialogue Procedure
The dialogue procedure is changed based on the skill level and the hastiness  . If a user is identified as having the high skill level  , the dialogue management is carried out in a user -initiated manner  ; namely , the system generates only open-ended prompts . On the other hand , when user?s skill level is detected as low , the system takes an initiative and prompts necessary items in order  . 
When the degree of hastiness is low , the system makes confirmation on the input contents  . Conversely , when the hastiness is detected as high , such a confirmation procedure is omitted . 
Contents of Responses
Information that should be included in the system response can be classified into the following two items  . 
1 . Dialogue management information 2 . Domain-specific information The dialogue management information specifies how to carry out the dialogue including the instruction on user?s expression like ? Please reply with either yes or no  . ? and the explanation about the following dialogue procedure like ? Now I will ask in order  . ? This dialogue management information is determined by the user?s skill level to the system  ,  58 . 8>= the maximum number of filled slots dialogue state initial state otherwise presense of barge -in rate of no input  0  . 07> 3012 average of recognition score 58 . 8< skill level high skill level high skill level low skill level low Figure  3: Decision tree for the skill level and is added to system responses when the skill level is considered as low  . 
The domain-specific information is generated according to the user?s knowledge level on the target domain  . Namely , for users unacquainted with the local information  , the system adds the explanation about the nearest bus stop  , and omits complicated contents such as a proposal of another route  . 
The contents described above are also controlled by the hastiness  . For users who are not in hurry , the system generates the additional contents as cooperative responses  . On the other hand , for hasty users , the contents are omitted in order to prevent the dialogue from being redundant  . 
3.3 Classification of User based on Decision

In order to implement the proposed user models as a classifier  , we adopt a decision tree . It is constructed by decision tree learning algorithm  C5  . 0 ( Quinlan , 1993) with data collected by our dialogue system . 
Figure 3 shows the derived decision tree for the skill level  . 
We use the features listed in Figure 4 . They include not only semantic information contained in the utterances but also information specific to spoken dialogue systems such as the silence duration prior to the utterance and the presence of barge-in  . Except for the last category of Figure 4 including ? attribute of specified bus stops ? , most of the features are domain-independent . 
The classification of each dimension is done for every user utterance except for knowledge level  . The model of a user can change during a dialogue . Features extracted from utterances are accumulated as history information during the session  . 
Figure 5 shows an example of the system behav- features obtained from a single utterance ? dialogue state  ( defined by already filled slots ) ? presence of barge-in?lapsed time of the current utterance ? recognition result  ( something recognized/uncertain/no input ) ? score of speech recognizer ? the number of filled slots by the current utterance  features obtained from the session ? the number of utterances ? dialogue state of the previous utterance ? lapsed time from the beginning of the session ? the number of repetitions of a same question ? the average number of repetitions of a same question ? ratio of the total time of user utterances in whole elapsed time ? ratio of the occurrence of barge-in out of the whole number of utterances ? recognition result of the previous utterance ? ratio of something recognized ? ratio of getting uncertain results ? ratio of no input ? the number of barge-in ? the number of something recognized ? the number of getting uncertain results ? the number of no input ? average of recognition scores ? the maximum number of slots filled by a single utterance  features obtained from the session  ( used only in classification of knowledge level ) ? attribute of specified bus stops ? the way to specify bus stops  ( whether a bus stop is specified by its correct name or not  ) ? ratio of each attribute of specified bus stops ? ratio of each way of specifying bus stops Figure  4: Features to classify the user model sior with the proposed user models  . The skill level is classified as being low by the decision tree  , because the first user?s utterance includes only one content word  . Then , dialogue procedure is changed to the system -initiated one  . Similarly , the hastiness is classified as being low by the decision tree  , and the system includes the explanation on the dialogue procedure and instruction on the expression in the responses  . They are omitted if the hastiness is identified as high  . 
3 . 4 Decision Tree Learning for User Models We train and evaluate the decision tree for the user models using dialogue data collected by our system  . 
The data was collected from December 10th   2001 to case : [ skill level:low ] [ knowledge level: low][hastiness:low]Sys:Pleasetellme your current bus stop  , your destination or the specific bus route number . 
User : Maruyama Park.
Sys : Let me confirm one by one.
( The explanation is added by [ skill level : low]  . )
Will you get on at Maruyama Park ? (  The content is confirmed by [ hastiness : low ] . )
Please reply with yes or no.
( The instruction is added by [ skill level : low]  . )
User : Yes.
Sys : Where will you get off the bus ? Please specify by a bus stop name or a wellknown landmark  . 
( The explanation is added by [ skill level : low]  . )
User : To fukuji temple.
Sys : Will you get off the busat To fukuj itemple ?
Please reply with yes or no.
User : Yes.
Sys : The following buses are located.
( The explanation is added by [ skill level : low  ]  . ) The nearest busstop to Maruyama Parkis Gion . 
( The domain information is added by [ knowledge level : low ]  . ) Bus number 202 bound for Nishioji-Kujo has de-parted Higashiyama - Sanjo  , which is two stops away .

The number of the sessions ( telephone calls ) is 215 , and the total number of utterances included in the sessions is  1492  . We annotated the subjective labels by hand . The annotator judges the user models for every utterances based on recorded speech data and logs  . The labels were given to the three dimensions described in section  3  . 3 among ? high ?, ? indeterminable ? or ? low ? . It is possible that annotated models of a user change during a dialogue  , especially from ? indeterminable ? to ? low ? or ? high ?  . The number of labeled utterances is shown in Table  1  . 
Using the labeled data , we evaluated the classification accuracy of the proposed user models  . All the experiments were carried out by the method of  10-fold crossvalidation . The process , in which one tenth of all data is used as the test data and the remainder is used as the training data  , is repeated ten times , and the average of the accuracy is computed . 
The result is shown in Table 2 . The conditions #1 , #2 and #3 in Table 2 are described as follows . 
# 1: The 10-fold crossvalidation is carried outper utterance . 
# 2: The 10-fold crossvalidation is carried outper session ( call )  . 
# 3: We calculate the accuracy under more realistic condition  . The accuracy is calculated not in three classes ( high/indeterminable/low ) but in two classes that actually affect the dialogue strategies  . For example , the accuracy for the skill level is calculated for the two classes : low and the others  . As to the classification of knowledge level , the accuracy is calculated for dialogue sessions because the features such as the attribute of a specified bus stop are not obtained in every utterance  . Moreover , in order to smooth unbalanced distribution of the training data  , a cost corresponding to the reciprocal ratio of the number of samples in each class is introduced  . By the cost , the chance rate of two classes becomes 50% . 
The difference between condition #1 and #2 is that the training was carried out in a speaker -closed or speaker-open manner  . The former shows better performance . 
The result in condition #3 shows useful accuracy in the skill level . The following features play important part in the decision tree for the skill level : the number of filled slots by the current utterance  , presence of barge-in and ratio of no input . For the knowledge level , recognition result ( something recognized/uncertain/no input )  , ratio of no input and the way to specify bus stops  ( whether a bus stop is specified by its exact name or not  ) are effective . The hastiness is classified mainly by the three features : presence of barge-in  , ratio of no input and lapsed time of the current utterance  .

The experiment was performed in the laboratory under adequate control  . For the speech input , the head set microphone was used . 
4.1 Experiment Procedure
First , we explained the outline of the system to subjects and gave the document in which experiment conditions and the scenarios were described  . We prepared two sets of eight scenarios . Subjects were requested to acquire the bus information using the system with/without the user models  . In the scenarios , neither the concrete names of bus stops nor the bus number were given  . For example , one of the scenarios was as follows : ? You are in Kyoto for sight seeing  . After visiting the Ginkakuj itemple , yougo to Maruyama Park . Supposing such a situation , please get information on the bus . ? We also set the constraint in order to vary the subjects ? hastiness such as ? Please hurry as much as possible in order to save the charge of your cellular phone  . ? The subjects were also told to look over questionnaire items before the experiment  , and filled in them after using each system . This aims to reduce the sub-ject?s cognitive load and possible confusion due to switching the systems  ( Over ,  1999) . The questionnaire consisted of eight items , for example , ? When the dialogue did not go well , did the system guide in-telligibly ?? We set seven steps for evaluation about each item  , and the subject selected one of them . 
Furthermore , subjects were asked to write down the obtained information : the name of the buss top to get on  , the bus number and how much time it takes before the bus arrives  . With this procedure , we planned to make the experiment condition close to the realistic one  .

UM : User Model
Table 3: Duration and the number of turns in dialogue The subjects were divided into two groups  ; a half ( group 1 ) used the system in the order of ? with user models  without user models ?  , the other half ( group 2 ) used in the reverse order . 
The dialogue management in the system without user models is also based on the mixed-initiative dialogue  . The system generates follow up questions and guidance if necessary  , but behaves in a fixed manner . Namely , additive cooperative contents corresponding to skill level described in section  3  . 2 are not generated and the dialogue procedure is changed only after recognition errors occur  . The system without user models behaves equivalently to the initial state of the user models : the hastiness is low  , the knowledge level is low and the skill level is high  . 
4.2 Results
All of the subjects successfully completed the given task  , although they had been allowed to give up if the system did not work well  . Namely , the task success rate is 100% . 
Average dialogue duration and the number of turns in respective cases are shown in Table  3  . 
Though the users had not experienced the system at all  , they got accustomed to the system very rapidly . 
Therefore , as shown in Table 3 , both the duration and the number of turns were decreased obviously in the latter half of the experiment in either group  . 
However , in the initial half of the experiment , the group 1 completed with significantly shorter dialogue than group  2  . This means that the incorporation of the user models is effective for novice users  . 
Table 4 shows a ratio of utterances for which the skill level was identified as high  . The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of utterances that were judged as high skill level by the number of all utterances in the eight sessions  . The ratio is much larger for group 1 who initially used the system with user group 1 with UM 0  . 72 ( with UMw/oUM ) w/o UM 0 . 70 group2 w/o UM 0 . 41 ( w/o UMwithUM ) with UM 0 . 6 3 Table 4: Ratio of utterances for which the skill level was judged as high models  . This fact means that novice users got accustomed to the system more rapidly with the user models  , because they were instructed on the usage by cooperative responses generated when the skill level is low  . The results demonstrate that cooperative responses generated according to the proposed user models can serve as good guidance for novice users  . 
In the latter half of the experiment , the dialogue duration and the number of turns were almost same between the two groups  . This result shows that the proposed models prevent the dialogue from becoming redundant for skilled users  , although generating cooperative responses for all users made the dialogue verbose in general  . It suggests that the proposed user models appropriately control the generation of cooperative responses by detecting characters of individual users  . 
5 Conclusions
We have proposed and evaluated user models for generating cooperative responses adaptively to individual users  . The proposed user models consist of the three dimensions : skill level to the system  , knowledge level on the target domain and the degree of hastiness  . The user models are identified using features specific to spoken dialogue systems as well as semantic attributes  . They are automatically derived by decision tree learning  , and all features used for skill level and hastiness are independent of domain-specific knowledge  . So , it is expected that the derived user models can be used in other domains generally  . 
The experimental evaluation with 20 novice users shows that the skill level of novice users was improved more rapidly by incorporating the user models  , and accordingly the dialogue duration becomes shorter more immediately  . The result is achieved by the generated cooperative responses based on the proposed user models  . The proposed user models also suppress the redundancy by changing the dialogue procedure and selecting contents of responses  . 
Thus , they realize user-adaptive dialogue strategies , in which the generated cooperative responses serve as good guidance for novice users without increasing the dialogue duration for skilled users  .
