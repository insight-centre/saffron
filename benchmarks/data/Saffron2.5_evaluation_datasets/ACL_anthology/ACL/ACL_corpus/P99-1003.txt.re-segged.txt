Computational linguistics is generally considered to be the branch of engineering that uses computers to do useful things with linguistic signals  , but it can also be viewed as an extended test of computational theories of human cognition  ; it is this latter perspective that psychologists find most interesting  . Language provides a critical test for the hypothesis that physical symbol systems are adequate to perform all human cognitive functions  . As yet , no adequate system for natural language processing has approached human levels of performance  . 
Of the various problems that natural anguage processing has revealed  , polysemy is probably the most frustrating . People deal with polysemy so easily that potential abiguities are overlooked  , whereas computers must work hard to do far less well  . A linguistic approach generally involves a parser  , a lexicon , and some adhoc rules for using linguistic on text o identify the context-appropriate sense  . A statistical approach generally involves the use of word cooccurrence statistics to create a semantic hyperspace where each word  , regardless of its polysemy , is represented as a single vector . Each approach as strengths and limitations ; some combination is often proposed . Various possibilities will be discussed in terms of their psychological pausibility  .
